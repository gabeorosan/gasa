Mountain Top - Radwimps

"Obey the way you truly believe
Don't let others rule over you"
Life will never be that easy with bag full of
All your ancestor's lessons

[Chorus]
I'm alone on a mountaintop
Nobody can answer me or none of them can follow me
But you climbed up high to the sky above
How do I look from your place right now?

[Verse 2]
Some might compete their bravery
They carry around in nicest box
Be careful not to forget the right way to open it up
Or you’ll miss when you need it then
You should keep it next to your soul

[Chorus]
I’m alone on a mountaintop
Nobody can answer me or none of them look straight at me
You climbed up high to the sky above
How am I supposed to hide my pride?

[Bridge]
I’m a dreamer, I’m believer, no surrender
Don’t even know way turning back
Let’s go deeper, let’s go higher, show me your ego

"Obey the way you truly believe
Don’t let others rule over you
Life will never be that easy," but hey, descendants
Guess that’s all I could say to you
All the rest is now up to youEmbed
