1 Contributorノットビコーズ (Not Because) Lyrics[RADWIMPS「ノットビコーズ」歌詞]

You loved me cuz I loved you
Not because that I'm the best

You're with me cuz I wanted to
Not because that you wanted to

You kissed me cuz I looked so pity
Not because that you missed me

You loved me,you're with me,and you kissed me
But not because…

For me you were the very one
For you I was one of all
Are there any ways to make you turn to me?

※Let's talk about love.about еverything you need
Everything that's something to do with our lovе
Talk about love,about everything we need
Everything that's something to do with our love※

Tu-tu-tu-tudu-du-tu

I kissed you,I hugged you
Just because that I wanted to
See RADWIMPS LiveGet tickets as low as $126You might also likeI cried for you,I laughed for you
Just because that you're beautiful

All these sadness I'm through is because of you
What the hell did you do to me
And my relations and my winding education
Now your my preoccupation
I had enough of this

For me you were the very one
For you I was one of all
Goodbye's for you,but that's just bad bad bye's for me

(※Repeat)

Let's talk about love,about dream,about
Everything that's something to do
Has got to be something to do with are world

Everything that's something to do with are world

Anything you said was everything to me
Nothing that you said was nothing to me
Cuz I love you ベイベー
And I really really want you ベイベ
(※Repeat)

Du-wala-du-wala what should I do to you

I should sing this song
Forever and ever

Not because that you didn't want meEmbed
