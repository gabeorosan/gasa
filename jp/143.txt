1 ContributorI I U LyricsSometimes I think of stupid things
Stupidest thing that you can think
How much will you be thinking of me
While I’m wasting
Almost everything of my life

I know that it’s so weird to ask you
To be more like me and not you
The reason that I loved you is 'cause you were so far from
Who I was those days

Is it us who made it difficult?
But it was us who made it possible
A thousand words will never make things simple or clear
So why don’t we hold hands
If ever we meet again

People ask for purpose of life
Instead I ask for a life without one
I wish for life away from
Your skin your lips your attention
That is too stuck in my mind

Sometimes I think of stupid things
Stupidest thing that you can think
Hurry just to finish this life and just vanish
To meet you at the next
Tell me which ride should I getSee RADWIMPS LiveGet tickets as low as $126You might also likeEmbed
