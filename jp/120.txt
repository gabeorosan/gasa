[Verse 1]
You might be scared
But that's your strength
You must be tired
Hold on a sec
You feel disgraced?
And full of shame
You're half way there
Until the light

[Verse 2]
Lack of hope?
No way to cope?
Sorry to say
I believe in you
That loneliness
Is all you have?
But you know what?
It's not your fault

[Chorus]
Someday we will talk all night
Of all that we've been through
No more tears no more sorrows
Only your brightest smile

About our hardest times
Until then we'll hold our hands together, soft and tight
Together we'll move on

[Verse 3]
Now wipe your tears
You don’t deserve
Will you show some smile?
Oh please, for me
Don’t blame yourself
Don’t hate yourself
You can be rude
You can be mean
I know you will
Be back in a while
To where we used to
Hang out a lot
I like who you are
I like who you are
I like who you are
I like who you are

[Chorus]
Someday we will talk all night
Of all that we've been through
No more tears no more sorrows
Only your brightest smile
Someday we will laugh all night
About our hardest times
Until then we'll hold our hands together, soft and tight
Together we'll move on

Someday we will talk all night
No more tears no more sorrows
Someday we will laugh all night
Until then we'll hold our hands together, soft and tightEmbed
