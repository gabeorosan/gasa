おとぎ (Otogi) - Radwimps
2 Contributorsおとぎ (Otogi) LyricsYou were just a friend of mine and
There were nothing more or less behind
In between the two of us, thus
I thought this will last forever
Why should we suppose to be a good guy
Girl that we're pretending to be
But yes, I was afraid to say
Goodbye to the days we went as ever

Over thousands miles away from here
Just searching for the lights that guides us here

You were there for me
And I was there for you
What else will you expect for love?
You’ve already knew, there's nothing so new
In that we're gave from birthday
I am happy, I hope you too
But yes, I am sad when you’re not in the mood
This is the very place in a fairy tale begins from "Once upon a time"

By the way you're the one who told me to get lost and said
"Please will you never to show up in front of me? Eternally"
I wished you didn't mean it but you never lied to me
We went over this again and again
But I feel something special when you call my name
So this is that love is all about
Who? What? When?
Doesn't matter all it matter's is now or never
See RADWIMPS LiveGet tickets as low as $126You might also likeOver thousands reason you have searched
But to tell the truth, to love someone
I'm pretty sure that one will do

You were there for me
And I was there for you
What else will you expect for love?
You've already knew, there's nothing so new
In what we’ve gave from birthday
I am happy, I hope you too
But yes, I am sad when you’re not in the mood
This is the very place in a fairy tale begins from "Once upon a time"

理由なんて一つでいいんだよ
信じてみてもいいんだよ
思い出に浸る暇もないってくらい
思い出作りたい
そしていつか読み返そう
むかしむかしあるところに...

You were there for me
And I was there for you
What else will you expect for love?
You've already knew, there’s nothing so new
In what we've gave from birthday
I am happy, I hope you too
But yes, I am sad when you're not in the mood
This is the very place in a fairy tale begins from "Once upon a time"
Now let's start our story with the line starts from "Once upon a time"Embed
