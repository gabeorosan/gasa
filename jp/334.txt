1 Contributorシリメツレツ (Shirimetsuretsu) Lyrics[RADWIMPS「シリメツレツ」歌詞]

This intension I can find inside
(Someone's listening)
But I found an answer without a reason beneath in me

Rhythm of this wood is singing closer than today
I look for something for you to tell

All this tension I desire to come
(Someone's whispering)
I found a reason that has no answer

Hiding from sadness and that's all about
Nothing could stop me besides going back
Singing is nothing but pain after all that's true
(Someone's listening)

If I was alone there's no need to be afraid to be
Being isolated by someone who doesn't evеn care

And I was the one wondеring
What if end will never to come to our lives
I guess no one'll love each other
Cuz there nothing to be afraid
ボクラニトワハナイダカラ　キョウヲオモエルノ

What I'm fighting with and it's all contagious
What I'm dying to get is hiding in one's silent
But it's all contagious

I'm here and you are there
And nothing closer can be so real
(THAT'S THE SADDEST WORD I EVEN HEARD)
So people tries to be more near and again and
Again there's another tear
(I CAN'T HOLD IT MORE)

But everything that happens has beginning and the ending
And that's what it Leeds us people to bed
Not even one said its end
ハジマリノナイ　ソレコソガトワダト　イウノ?

What is hiding in my mind is
What I'm fighting with and it's all contagious
What I'm dying to get is hiding in one's silent
But it's all contagiousEmbed
