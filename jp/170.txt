[Intro]
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up, when you come back
I'll be here
I'll be waiting here for you

[Verse 1]
I can be your best friend
I can be your lease friend
I can be your boyfriend
But I don't wanna be your ex-friend
Don't you know this guy who sang a song
About the highest common factor and so?
It's kind of how this is
I'll tell you what it is
About all your questions you have asked

[Chorus]
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up, when you come back
I'll be here, I'll be waiting here for you
If the size of the sky makes you frighten then come back
And then cry so that I might could hug you

これで5度目の別れ話です でも今回はどこか違うんです
いつもの『忍法・記憶喪失』もなぜか今回は効かないんです

「もういやだ」って思っていたんならそれでも僕はいいけど
「さよなら」って言ったのは君なのに なんで泣いたの?

[Chorus]
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up, when you come back
If that answer is "no", what should I do?
Should I cry? Should I die?
Or go crazy and then fly
Better yet should I kiss myself ドンマイ

[Bridge]
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up, when you come back
Pick me up
Pick me up
Pick me up, when you come back
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up, when you come back
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up, when you come back
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up, when you come back
I'll be here, I'll be waiting here for you
Pick me up
Pick me up
Pick me up, when you come back
Until then, I will save this song for you

[Outro]
Now come back
Now come back
Now come back, I'll take it back
I'll be here
I'll be here, I'll waiting here for youEmbed
