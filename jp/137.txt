Shape Of Miracle - Radwimps
1 ContributorShape Of Miracle Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hello, so you are my miracle
Where are your eyes to look into?
How are you? I’ve been longing for you
Where is your mouth to question, why?

[Verse 2]
Don’t leave your words, bring them with you now
You’re still in charge of what you felt
No one can tell you how to finish your
Love that was so easy to start

[Refrain]
Woo
Woo

[Verse 3]
Hello, my dearest one miracle
You are capricious and unkind
You’re always hiding in back of fate
Now is the time to do your job

[Refrain]
Woo
Woo

[Verse 5]
Hello, if you are my miracle
Where are your eyes to look into?
Where are your tears running from?

[Refrain]

[Bridge]
I will let you go
I will let you go

[Verse 6]
I won’t say goodbye, I won’t look behind
I will just leave my deepest sorrows behind
As big as all of the joy we raise togetherEmbed
