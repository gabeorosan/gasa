Lights Go Out - Radwimps
4 ContributorsLights Go Out Lyrics[Intro]
Lights go out and night goes in
I wonder why the stars won't blink
While I'm asleep, will you be awake?
And keep an eye on the sky
So they might sneak in the night
Sneak in your heart

[Verse 1]
You said, you never wished upon a star
'Cause they're too far to trust
It's not a distance you don't even trust
Your mouth, 5 inches away

[Pre-Chorus]
Goodbye tomorrow
Good night, "hello"

[Chorus]
Whoever now is knocking on your door
Is what you truly hope to owe
I'll fly like you
Here's a promise
I'll fly like you

[Verse 2]
You said, you never wished upon a star
'Cause they're too far to trust
So how close should I be standing
When I'm 'bout to make my confession to you?

I do love you
How did it make you feel?

[Chorus]
Whoever now is knocking on your door
Is what you truly hope to know
I'll fly like you
Here's a promise (I'll fly like you)
Whoever now is knocking on your door
Is what you truly hope to owe
I'll fly like you
Here's a promise (I'll fly like you)
Whoever now is knocking on your door
Is what you truly hope to show
I'll fly like you
Here's a promise
I'll fly like youEmbed
