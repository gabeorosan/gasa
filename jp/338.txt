1 Contributor嫌ん (Iyan) Lyrics[RADWIMPS「嫌ん」歌詞]

All these words are meant to be so what?
All these hates are said to me so what?
All these words are meant to be so what?
All these hates are said to me…

出会い 触れ合い 心交し合い 今の僕に向けたかけがえのない
深い 愛すべてを忘れることなく 時と共に僕の性に囁く
だけどなぜ? 単純に死ぬまで この世に何も与えず死ねるわけ?
こんな俺なら 笑いながら デカイことで 役に立ってやるから

You never see the lights that shines behind your eyes
Although it's brighter than the brightest sun
But you never turn around to see how it shines
You never know why you can see it in your eyes
Why these words coming out of my mind
You never know what keeps me high in these nights

I might fall into pieces with all my compensates
But theres one thing i've learned

There's no such thing as fear
(What for do I live? What can I do?)

I said I just don't have to be me
I mean you just don't have to be you
I guess I wanna be the man who's never born

I mean you just don't have to be you
I guess I wanna be the man who's never born

夢見るために生きてるわけじゃない
他にいくらもすることあるじゃない
What for do you ask 「What for?」 ?
なくした純粋さ 隠した平凡さ 探してたフリしてただけなんだ

Why do I live? What can I be?
普遍の人生のテーマを 譜面に載せて歌うけれど
What for do you ask? What am I?

I said I just don't have to be me
I mean you just don't have to be you
I guess I wanna be the man who's never born

I said I just don't have to be me
I mean you just don't have to be you
I guess I wanna be the man who's never born

They'll never say all these words are meant to be…
They'll never say all these hates are said to me…

I said I just don't have to be me
I mean you just don't have to be you
I guess I wanna be the man who's never born
I said I just don't have to be me
I mean you just don't have to be you
I guess I wanna be the man who's never born

I said I just don't have to be me
I mean you just don't have to be you
I guess I wanna be the man who's never born

I said I just don't have to be me
I mean you just don't have to be you
I guess I wanna be the man who's never born
