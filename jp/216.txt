2 Contributors傘拍子 (Sanbyoshi) Lyrics[RADWIMPS「傘拍子」歌詞]

I wish that I could only sing this in the rain
Cuz I know for sure that this'll make me cry again
I never imagined that this song was about a pain
But I'll try my best and I shall make it to the end

I wish that I could sing a song that you'll be touched
For that I guess vocabularies I have isn't as much
But I hope you'll feel something no matter if it's a stitch
I know you hate sympathy but please give me an inch

Cuz it's all because of you
Cuz it's all because of you

I wish my name were something like'Darling or Dear'
Then every time you call my name we'd be as if we're pair
I know for sure my brain is need to be repaired
I'm afraid to say but you're the one who made me a hare

And it's the only'I'can be
It's the only'life'I can live

I wish that I could be the laces on your shoes
Then I'll trust you I'll never let you stumble and make you a bruise
I wish that I could only breath in front of you
Then I guess I'll just have to turn my life for you

I wish that I could play the role within your life
I wish that I could write the lyrics that you'll love
I wish that I could be the emblem of your love

I wish that I could only sing this in the rain
Cuz I know for sure that this'll make me cry again
I never imagined that this song was about a vain
But I'd tried my best I can do…Embed
