I was just hiding from the words you left behind
It makes me sick but also makes me feel alive

Well did I never tried to provoke this case
I'm the one who was trying to prevent this fate
I was just doing fine making love with haze
Until you came and kissed me on my youth

Since I have trust myself whatever comes what may
From time to time my integrity comes in to play

As I walk through the path of this world these days
Why did I never mentioned this huge mistakes
Well she told me it's cuz of its awkward age
So that I have tried my best
And so I tried my best

I've been singing, I've been dreaming
I've been doing everything
But even though all I could do is just a bit
And it's kinda sad

Such as screaming in the toilet
And use all the toilet papers
And polluting all the air producing carbon dioxide

Though I tried to kill myself my genius won't let go
And so I'm here today again

I've been singing, I've been dreaming
I've been doing everything
But even though all I could do is just a bit
And it's kinda sad

Such as screaming in the toilet
And use all the toilet papers
And polluting all the air producing carbon dioxide

Now I had enough of it and now's the time to final it but
Though I tried to kill myself my genius won't let go
Every time you call my name you make me feel awake again
And so

There's no time living twice a time
But there's plenty of time living nice and high
Well so am I Am I? Am I? Am I?
Am I? Am I? Am I?

There's no time for you to find it out
But there's plenty of time for you to shout it out
And so do I Do I? Do I? Do I?
Do I? Do I? Do I? Do I?
Am I? Am I? Am I? Am I?
