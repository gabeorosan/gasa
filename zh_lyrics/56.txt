1 ContributorMoon And Back Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a million ways to love ya
But I don't know where to start
There's a man I have to run to
But you're the one I want
Yeah, you're the one I want
Yeah, you're the one I want
There's a million ways to love ya
But you're the one I want
Yeah, you're the one I want

[Chorus]
I love you to the moon and back, to the moon and back
Call me crazy, but baby
I love you to the moon and back, to the moon and back
Love is crazy
So let me take ya
(Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey)

[Verse 2]
I will crawl up in a miles
To be right there when you are
I'm your lightning in a bottle
And you're the one I want
Yeah, you're the one I want (Hey)
Yeah, you're the one I want (Hey)
I'm your lightning in a bottle
And you're the one I want
Yeah, you're the one I want

I love you to the moon and back, to the moon and back
Call me crazy, but baby
I love you to the moon and back, to the moon and back
Love is crazy
So let me take ya
(Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey)

[Bridge]
After all that every night
Unforgettable sunrise
We're brighter than these lights, yeah, we're bigger than this sky
So let me take ya

[Chorus]
I love you to the moon and back, (Hey) to the moon and back
Call me crazy, (Hey) but baby
I love you to the moon and back, (Hey) to the moon and back
Love is crazy (Hey)
So let me take ya
(Love you to the moon and back)
So let me take ya
(Love you to the moon and back)
So let me take ya
(Love you to the moon and back)
So let me take ya
(Love you to the moon and back)
To the moon, to the moon, to the moon and backEmbed
