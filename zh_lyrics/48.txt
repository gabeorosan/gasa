Exit This Way - Wanting Qu
1 ContributorExit This Way Lyrics[Verse]
This coffee's getting cold, this joke is getting old
This time be the last time I'm crying over you (Wrap up) (Haha)
I'm running around looking for, for an answer sadly untold
Misguided signs, I'm not sold on your

[Pre-Chorus]
Many ways, many faces, your story isn't going to play
And I'm tired of running around, tired of you playing around
Tired of coasting along
And I'm not gonna lose my voice over you

[Chorus]
I don't think you'll understand what I'm about to say
So read my lips, I won't repeat myself again
I need you to exit this way
I need you to exit this way

[Verse]
This coffee's getting cold, this joke is getting old
This time be the last time I'm crying over you (Wrap up) (Ha)
I'm running around looking for, for an answer sadly untold
Misguided signs, I'm not sold on your

[Pre-Chorus]
Many ways, many faces, your story isn't going to play
And I'm tired of running around, tired of you playing around
Tired of coasting along
And I'm not gonna lose my voice over you
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't think you'll understand what I'm about to say
So read my lips, I won't repeat myself again
I need you to exit this way
I need you to exit this way

[Outro]
I need you to exit this way
I need you to exit this wayEmbed
