2 ContributorsHand Hold LyricsSweetheart, sweetheart
Won’t you come and sweep me off my feet
Catch me when I fall
Whisper whisper
Whisper these words in my ear tonight, I could fly away with you, I…
When the darkness is falling
When the night has come
Baby will you hold my hand?
When the sky is crying
When this road is near the end
Baby I will hold your hand
Sweetheart, sweetheart
Mark my words and cross my heart
I’ll wait for you till the end
What it is, what it is
It’s a kiss from my lips sealed on yours, and today I’ll stay with you, I…
When the darkness is falling
When the night has come
Baby will you hold my hand?
When the sky is crying
When this road is near the end
Baby I will hold your hand
When the storm is twisting left and right
When you can’t fall asleep at night
Baby I will hold your hand
Until the night is morning
Until the seas apart
I won’t let go of your handYou might also likeEmbed
