Make Love To This Song - Wanting Qu
1 ContributorMake Love To This Song Lyrics[Chorus]
We don't need to go out on the town
We can dance on the patio and sing at the top of our lungs
You don't need this, take it off, take it off
We can go under the covers and make love to this song

[Verse 1]
I use to be a wild child
But for you I want to be tamed
Rolling solo was my style
And now you got me changing my ways
My mind just slipped, drunk off your kiss
I never thought love would feel like this
Tripped up in your spell
Tonight I'm gonna keep you all to myself

[Pre-Chorus]
All your waking dreams
Lie right here with me

[Chorus]
We don't need to go out on the town
We can dance on the patio and sing at the top of our lungs (Hey)
You don't need this, take it off, take it off
We can go under the covers and make love to this song (Ow)
You might also like[Verse 2]
Fingertips electric
White lightning strike in your touch
Bodies magnetic
Call out my name, make me blush
Lost in bliss drunk off your kiss
Never thought love would feel like this
Take my breath, don't stop
Right up to the edge, put the world on pause

[Pre-Chorus]
All your waking dreams (Ooh)
Lie right here with me

[Chorus]
We don't need to go out on the town
We can dance on the patio and sing at the top of our lungs (Hey)
You don't need this, take it off, take it off
We can go under the covers and make love to this song (Ow)
We don't need to go out on the town
We can dance on the patio and sing at the top of our lungs (Hey)
You don't need this, take it off, take it off
We can go under the covers and make love to this song (Ow)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-la-la (Woo), ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la (Woo), ooh-la-la (Woo)
Ooh-la-la (Woo), ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la (Woo), ooh-la-la (Hey)

Ooh-la-la, ooh-ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la, ah-ooh-la-la (Hey)
[Chorus]
We don't need to go out on the town
We can dance on the patio and sing at the top of our lungs
You don't need this, take it off, take it off
We can go under the covers and make love to this song (Ow)
(We don't need to go out on the town, we can make love to this song) (Hey)
Make love, make love, make love, make love to this song
No need to go out, we can dance and sing
You don't need this, take it off, make love to this song (Hey)
