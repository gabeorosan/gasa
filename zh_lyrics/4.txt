Treasure - Vicky Chen
1 ContributorTreasure LyricsDarlin you’ve been waiting all alone
我仍迷失在這混亂中
感情總與幻想的不同
期待過多而窒息難受
想握緊卻傷了你的手

Give a little time
Give a little while
I know that I was wrong
I can face it all and
Give a little time
Give a little while
I know I’ll make it through

And treasure you
I’ll treasure you

Maybe it’s just time to let it go
理性澆不息我的感受
不想再放任情緒左右
再走一步就能更成熟
鬆開才能親吻你的手

Just give a little time
Give a little while
I know that I was wrong
I can face it all and
Give a little time
Give a little while
I know I’ll make it through
You might also likeAnd treasure you
I’ll treasure you

Give a littlе time
Give a little whilе
I know that I was wrong
I can face it all and
Give a little time
Give a little while
I know I’ll make it through

And treasure you
I’ll treasure youEmbed
