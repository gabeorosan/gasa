Set You Free - Wanting Qu
1 ContributorSet You Free Lyrics[Verse 1]
All I wanted you to do is listen
'Cause there's nowhere else I'd rather be
Then in this bed of this conversation, I need a reaction
I try so hard to find a reason
To stay here when I wanna disappear
I left all my words inside this moment
So will you listen?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your body's here, but your mind is somewhere else
Your eyes on me, but you don't see me at all

[Chorus]
If I was gonna make you happy
Then how come I don't make you happy?
If you say it's time to let you go
I will set you free
And even when I say I love you
You know that I will always love you
If you say it's time to let you go
I will set you free (Free-eh-oh)
I will set you free

[Verse 2]
I do what I have to do to make you
Make me feel like I'm your number one
Whatever happened to forever?
Has forever come undone?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Your body's here, but your mind is somewhere else
Your eyes on me, but you don't see me at all, at all, at all, at all

[Chorus]
If I was gonna make you happy
Then how come I don't make you happy?
If you say it's time to let you go
I will set you free
Even when I say I love you
You know that I will always love you
If you say it's time to let you go
I will set you free (Free)
I will set you free (Eh-oh)
And I will set you free (I will set you free, eh-oh)

[Bridge]
I'm standing right here, right here, right here in front of you
Holding my hands, understand there is nothing that I wouldn't do
Oh, tell me right now, right now, right now 'cause I need to know
I'm about to break (I'm about to break)
I'm about to break (I'm about to break)
I gotta let you go, no

[Chorus]
If I was gonna make you happy
Then how come I don't make you happy?
If you say it's time to let you go
I will set you free
Even when I say I love you (Even when I say I love you)
You know that I will always love you (You know that I will always love you)
If you say it's time to let you go
I will set you free (Free)
I will set you free (Eh-oh)
I will set you free (I will set you free)
[Outro]
I will set you free
I will set you free
And I will set you free
I will set you freeEmbed
