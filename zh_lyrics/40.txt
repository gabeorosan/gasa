Shell - Wanting Qu
2 ContributorsShell LyricsThoughts are running through my head
Reluctance to failure, I refuse to cry
The outside showers the opening wound
I trip and fall until
Redundancy catches me up, I have no where to go
While she feeds me I hate myself, tears coming down I choke
The hour fills with wish and hope but the hour is gone
I threw myself, then I became a shell
Truth is, is not what you see
You see what you want to believe
There’s so much more to offer inside of me
But I can’t come out because
Redundancy catches me up, I have no where to go
While she feeds me I hate myself, tears coming down I choke
The hour fills with wish and hope but the hour is gone
I threw myself, then I became a shell
Became a shell, became a shell, became a shell…
The outside, showers the opening wound
I trip and fall...
Redundancy catches me up, I have no where to go
While she feeds me I hate myself, tears coming down I choke
The hour fills with wish and hope but the hour is gone
I threw myself, and I became a shellYou might also likeEmbed
