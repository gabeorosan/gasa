2 ContributorsAnxiety LyricsThose monsters under my bed
Ghosts clouding my head
Are these the only reasons
I feel trapped in, I feel trapped in my fear
Anxiety, taking hold of me
Pulling me down, pulling me down
Those monsters in my head
Memories that I thought were dead
A black hole in my chest
I fell to blacken depth
Anxiety taking hold of me
Pulling me down, pulling me down

I’ve never wanted to feel like this, to feel like this, to feel like this
Anxiety, taking hold of me
Pulling me down, pulling me down
Anxiety, always grabbing me
Pulling me down, pulling me downYou might also likeEmbed
