Papercut - OOHYO
2 ContributorsPapercut Lyrics[우효 "Papercut (Korean Version)" 가사]

[Verse 1]
바람에 날려갔으면
강물에 실려갔으면
무심히 나를 베었던
기억들이 떠나갔으면
보이지 않는 선들이
지워졌으면
훨훨 날아갔으면
모든 게 꿈이었으면
뭐든지 할 수 있는걸
없던 일이 될 수만 있다면, oh
Time, oh

[Chorus]
Papercut you gave me
Just a papercut you left me
Papercut you gave me
Just a papercut you left me
Papercut
Cut
Papercut
Cut

[Verse 2]
I did my best to read your eyes
To read between your pretty lies
But now I'm such a wreck you see
For me it's already the end of time
You might also like[Chorus]
Papercut you gave me
Just a papercut you left me
Papercut you gave me
Just a papercut you left me
Papercut
Cut
Papercut
Cut
Papercut
Cut
Papercut
Cut

[Outro]
All this time you gave me
Nothing left to keep
But it's time to let you go
To see you in your dreamsEmbed
