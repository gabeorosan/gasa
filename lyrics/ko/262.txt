BRAVE (single cut) - OOHYO
1 ContributorBRAVE (single cut) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every little moment that you wish that you were stronger
Every little moment of despair
Every little word that loses meaning in the air
Every little voice that goes unheard

[Verse 2]
Every single day that passes by as if the wind
Always steady yet so out of reach
Every stormy sea that sets ablaze a whole new fear
Every little sweet lie in disguise

[Chorus]
Is it true that even tears can turn to gold?
Is it truе that after all we'll get back homе?
When you're following the light
And your heart is open wide
Love will hope and hope and hope and guide you further

[Post-Chorus]
Wanna climb mountains with you
Push boundaries with you
Wanna be braver than ever
Braver for you
Wanna swim oceans with you
Wanna break records with you
Wanna dive deep
Make this one leap
I'm all in for you
You might also like[Refrain]
Wanna be brave, brave, brave, brave
Brave, brave, brave, brave
Wanna be brave, brave, brave, brave
Brave, brave, brave

[Chorus]
Is it true that even tears can turn to gold?
Can it grow a tree that bears the fruits of hope?
When we're following the light
And our heart is open wide
Love will hope and hope and hope and guide us further

[Post-Chorus]
Wanna climb mountains with you
Wanna push boundaries with you
Wanna be braver than ever
Braver for you
Wanna swim oceans with you
Wanna break records with you
Wanna dive deep
Make this one leap
I'm all in for you

[Refrain]
Wanna be brave, brave, brave, brave
Brave, brave, brave, brave
Wanna be brave, brave, brave, brave
Brave, brave, brave, braveEmbed
