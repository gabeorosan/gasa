PIZZA (Kai Takahashi Remix) - OOHYO
1 ContributorPIZZA (Kai Takahashi Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Summer's been boring without you
Empty talk and entertainment
Been yawning every minute or so
Waiting for the phone to ring

[Verse 2]
What's gotten into me?
Can anybody see?
Oh, love's a crazy game
I don't know how to play
To make you want to stay
I'm too scared to say

[Chorus]
That I want you, I want you back
'Cause I want you, I want you bad
'Cause pizza sucks without you
It's not a question of appetite
Pizza sucks without you
Anyway

[Verse 3]
Mom and dad out for a movie
I'm stuck at home watching re-runs
Don't really feel like going out in the city
Or on the net where everyone's trying to look pretty
'Cause I ain't got no time to impress
To try and live up to anyone's stupid interest
See, I ain't got no time to look back
To wonder how it might have been if I had tried
You might also like[Chorus]
That I want you, I want you back
'Cause I want you, I want you bad
'Cause pizza sucks without you
It's not a question of appetite
Pizza sucks without you
Anyway

[Outro]
Pizza sucks without you
Every day is a bore without you
Pizza sucks without you
Every day is a bore without you
Pizza sucks without you
It's not a question of appetite
Pizza sucks without you
AnywayEmbed
