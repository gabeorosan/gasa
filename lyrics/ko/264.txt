Enough - OOHYO
3 ContributorsEnough Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just here with you
In the quiet
There's nothing more
To life
And it's enough
It's enough
To make me smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Just you and me
In the stillness
Now I know what
You really meant
And it's enough
It's enough
To satisfy

[Chorus]
Suddenly a song
To sing along
No matter how far
My hopes and dreams
Height of the skies
Stars in your eyes
Make enough room
To breathe
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Height of the skies
Stars in your eyes
Make enough room
To breathe
It's enough, it's enough
For me

[Verse 2]
Suddenly a tear
A happy one
I'd shed a million
For you
Cuz you're enough
You're enough
For me

[Chorus]
Suddenly a song
To sing along
No matter how far
My hopes and dreams
Height of the skies
Stars in your eyes
Make enough room
To breathe
[Post-Chorus]
Height of the skies
Stars in your eyes
Make enough room
To breathe
It's enough, it's enough
For meEmbed
