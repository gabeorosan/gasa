NAIVE - OOHYO
3 ContributorsNAIVE Lyrics[우효 "NAIVE" 가사]

[Verse 1]
사람들은 말해
"Hey, you gotta watch out
'Cause nothing in this world
Is gonna be yours
Forever
Forever
Forever
And ever"

[Verse 2]
(몇시야?)
It's time to work out again
Time to move houses again
Time for a plane ride again
Look for a home again
It's not forever
Forever
Forever
And ever
Forever
And ever
Forever
And ever

All this time I've wondered
When I'll be back home
Dancing in the moonlight
I alone silently waitEmbed
