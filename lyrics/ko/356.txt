Goodfeeling - 비비
3 ContributorsGoodfeeling Lyrics[Chorus 1]
When I wake up in the morning
If you there I would be glad
And you are just around with me
I'll be thrilled and you'll be cared
Fuck distance, I can get you in my dream
We can hold in each other all night no more
When you chilling in the bed
If I was there you would be glad
니 팔 안에서 니 품 안에서 노닐고파
No matter if early morning or late night time
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you

[Verse 1]
날 데리러 와줘요, 날 만나러 와줘요
내가 흔들리지 않게 날 잡으러 와줘요
그대는 어디 있나요? 무엇을 하고 있나요?
그리워 하고 있어요, 그리워 하고 있어요
Come whenever you want
Come wherever you want
With me wherever you want
See me wherever you want
Thinking every moment
'Bout you every moment
With you every moment
See you every moment

When I wake up in the morning
If you there I would be glad
When you chilling in the bed
If I was there you would be glad
If you are just around with me
I'll be thrilled and you will be cared
니 팔 안에서 니 품 안에서 노닐고파
When I wake up in the morning
If you there I would be glad
If you are just around with me
I'll be thrilled and you'll be cared
When you chilling in the bed
If I was there you would be glad
니 팔 안에서 니 품 안에서 노닐고파Embed
