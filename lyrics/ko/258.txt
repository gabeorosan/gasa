New Shoes - OOHYO
2 ContributorsNew Shoes Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am a child crying in the shower
Looking at the bruises on her feet
New shoes she bought
Don’t fit her at all, at all

[Verse 2]
I am a bird singing by your window
Humming to the songs you play at night
Looking up at me
You’ll be thinking something like this

[Chorus]
Oh, little bird
Wish I could fly like you
Only if I could fly
Wish I could fly like you

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I’ll sit out on the bench
Sometimes I’ll miss out on the fun
Won’t be too long
Till I finally get back home
And you’ll be right here with me
Here with me
You’ll be right, here with me
And you’ll be right, here with me
You might also like[Verse 4]
You callеd me yours
And I’m satisfied
You called mе yours, yours
Yours, yours
And I’m satisfied, satisfiedEmbed
