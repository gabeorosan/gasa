[Chorus]
Give a little more, give a little more
Care a little less, care a little less
Give a little more, give a little more
Care a little less, care a little less
Give a little more, give a little more
Care a little less, care a little less
Give a little more, give a little more
Care a little less, care a little less

[Verse 1]
Give a little more, give a little more
지금 give a less care on my ring-ring, baby
내일이 되면 모레가 되면 우린
마주쳐도 얼굴 붉히지 않게
Chicks gonna get you
Chicks gonna hate you
Chicks tryna keep you
In her feelings too
근데 걔는 모르지 너를 지갑 속에
혹은 디올 백에 넣을 수 없으니
You nice, give 'er that I know
So I'm gonna take it
Not gonna keep it
Let things go on
Let things just flow

Give a little more, give a little more (Give a little more)
Care a little less, care a little less (Care a little less)
Give a little more, give a little more (Oh)
Care a little less, care a little less (Care a little less)
Give a little more, give a little more
Care a little less, care a little less
Give a little more, give a little more (Give a little more, give a little more)
Care a little less, care a little less (Care a little less)

[Verse 2]
Care a little less, care a little less 지금
Save it for me, baby, 조금 있다
어젯밤 또 그제 날 밤처럼
마주쳐도 얼굴 붉히지 않게
선이 있다면 I'm in the zone
악이 있다면 이불 속에서
어제와 내일 사이에
E for no emotion 이기에
Maximum effort in here, baby
내일이 되면 모른 척 스쳐 지나가는
사이가되니
I'm gonna take it, not gonna keep it

[Chorus]
Give a little more, give a little more
Care a little less, care a little less
Give a little more, give a little more (Yeah)
Care a little less, care a little less
Give a little more, give a little more (Yeah)
Care a little less, care a little less
Give a little more, give a little more (Yeah)
Care a little less, care a little less
[Outro]
I'm feeling like oh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
