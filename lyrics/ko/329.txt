1 ContributorYoura - He or She (English Translation) Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
He or She
The names that have been on
My lips the most in my life
I laid down my anxiety and transformed it into love
The little ditch in his arms is unbelievably warm
The days are filled and covered with color

[Chorus]
I'm in the shade all my life
What a pain
What a pain
Woe is me
Oh, the pain

[Verse 1]
The crumbling sits on a peaceful tabletop
Even the birds on their little romantic spring picnic
How hard you have guarded your harun?

[Pre-Chorus]
He or She
The names that have been on
My lips the most in my life
I laid down my anxiety and transformed it into love
The little ditch in his arms is unbelievably warm
The days are filled and covered with color
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm in the shade all my life
What a pain
What a pain
Woe is me
Oh, the pain

[Verse 2]
People always go round in circles
My little flower bed I'll say goodbye and say hello
Take Care
Take care of yourself

[Outro]
He or She
The names that have been on
My lips the most in my life
I laid down my anxiety and transformed it into loveEmbed
