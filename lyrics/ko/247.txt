ENTS - OOHYO
2 ContributorsENTS Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somebody’s gotta tell
These kids to go back home
You don’t know what you’re getting yourselves into
Somebody’s gotta tell
These kids what is right
Somebody’s got to tell
These kids to know what’s death, what’s life

[Chorus 1]
Everyone needs the sun
Everyone needs some rain
Sometimes a rain that pours
Down all our shame away
A voice you can’t ignore
A look you can’t deny
It’s been there all this time
Just for you
(Everyone needs the sun)

[Verse 2]
I’m not too good for you
You know I ain’t no angel
I’m only good to you because I know you are my maker
Can’t be a fool for you and there’s no way to pay back
All that’s been paid by you just for this
Soul to get its name back
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Everyone needs a song
Everyone needs a story
A reason to go on
And see some hope still soaring but
No one can take your place
No one can nail you down
I want this life to be all for you
(Everyone needs the sun
Everyone needs the sun)Embed
