So What - 비비
2 ContributorsSo What Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, I dig this shit
Oh yeah, I dig that shit
Y'all bitches talking shit
Are you guys part of this shit?
내 인생 사는 법이 틀렸을 수도 있지
니가 음악을 못해도 열심히 하는 듯이

[Refrain]
So what (So what)
So what (So what)
So what (So what)
So what (So what)

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, I made this shit
Oh yeah, I said that shit
Man, I am naked bibi, what do you guys want from it?
Bitch I can pay for this shit
할 수 있는 깡은 없지
쟤가 돈이 없어도 비싼 옷을 사 입듯이

[Refrain]
So what (So what, So what, So what, So what)
So what (So what, So what, So what, So what)
So what (So what, So what, So what, So what)
So what (So what, So what, So what, So what)

Oh yeah, I do this shit
Oh yeah, I do that shit
If I am bothering you, I can just get out of this shit
딴남자를 lock it, unlock it, and zip it, unzip it
나를 놀리든지 흉 보든지 니 알아서
I ain’t takin’ risky shit
I have been say to thang
Take one for me, give one for you
이해관계 성립 shit
내 인생 사는 법이 틀렸을 수도 있지
니가 날 씹지 못해도 열심히 하는 듯이

[Refrain]
So what
So what
So what
So what

[Verse 4]
I have been through this shit
I have been through this shit
I have been through this shit
I have been through this shit
Believe me through this shit
Ay but 난 0에서 갓 태어난 하룻강아지
My boss는 slum이 아니지
My boss는 hate me 아니지
[Refrain]
