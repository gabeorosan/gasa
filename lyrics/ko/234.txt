UTO - OOHYO
2 ContributorsUTO Lyrics[Verse 1]
She’s got a box full of things
And a lot of them don’t work
You don’t get to see them all
See them all
See them all
Today

[Verse 2]
She’s got a room full of boys
And a lot of them are cute
But they don’t give her what she wants
What she wants
What she wants
Today

[Chorus 1]
So giddy up now
She’s going on a trip
She won’t let them tears fall down and drip
How ya feeling today
Oh, never better
It’s a chance now
She won’t let it slip
She will stand up straight and tighten her grip
The adventure will start today

She’s got a lot on her mind
Even more inside her heart
You won’t get to see them all
See them all
See them all
Today

[Verse 4]
She’s got her eyes on the light
Getting ready for the flight
All she wants is the big blue sky
Big black sky
Orange sky
Purple sky

[Chorus 2]
Rising up now
We’re coming back to life
We are reaching for the stars tonight
Have you noticed
The sun’s again on time
Yeah
Take a look now
We’re finally on the clouds
We can sing of love and truth out loud
The adventure will start
Today
[Outro]
I’m a free bird
Don’t care what they say
I’m a free bird1Embed
