2020 - OOHYO
3 Contributors2020 Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
I wish I could but I can’t
I wish I could but I can’t

[Verse 1]
Enough make-up videos
Why don’t you make up your mind?
Play with the kids
Walk the dog
Or just write something

[Verse 2]
Thirty four, beginner’s guide?
If there’s such thing, it’s one big lie
Thought I’d know where I’d be
By the time it turned 2020

(Never let it slip)

[Chorus]
One two three
Put an end to all of this
Four five six
I didn’t sign up for this
Hypocrisy
Some like to call
Relativity
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Contrary to popular belief
I don’t mind being called a nobody
So cross me out
If you want that life
That universe

[Verse 2]
Truth is served
As all-you-can-eat
Here in this hyperreality

[Refrain]
All I know is that I’ll be
Somewhere nicer in 2020
All I know is that I’ll be
Somewhere nicer in 2020

[Chorus]
One two three
Put an end to all of this
Four five six
He didn’t come up with this
Hypocrisy
Why can’t you see
[Post-Chorus]
Contrary to popular belief
I don’t mind being called a nobody
So cross me out
If you want that life
That universeEmbed
