A Good Day - OOHYO
6 ContributorsA Good Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
Singing every day
Every night, every dream
Looking like a ghost
Waiting for a small retreat
Scratch that, you really want that kind of life?

[Verse 2]
People watching on a bench
Summer out of town
Kicking back the soccer balls
For the little guys
Hey missy, let's get some time out for you now

[Chorus]
"I ain’t got the guts, got the strength, got the time"
That’s all you gotta say to love that has just arrived
No one’s stopping you anyway, anyhow
There’s always something more, something else, something left
To consume to the best of your interest
Life’s long, everlasting in the end
When it’s only about you

[Verse 3]
While the world clings to what’s new
Newest way to think
Newest way to love, newest way to see yourself
I cry in the middle of the night
You might also like[Verse 4]
I slowly drift away
Hidin' my face from the shadow of the shame
Looming over everything that ever was
Meant to be loved

[Chorus]
Softening my voice, never looking in the eye
I walk away from all that promises a good time
A good day, a good life, that’s all they want
It’s in the air we breathe, everything that hurts us
I tiptoe past the ghosts that keep on telling us
"Life’s long everlasting in the end and it’s only about you"Embed
