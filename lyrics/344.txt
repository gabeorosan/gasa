Wet Nightmare - 비비
7 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsWet Nightmare Lyrics[비비 "Wet Nightmare" 가사]

[Verse 1]
Pop champagne all night
Put the chandelier up high
Bodies on my bed
All my baddies gonna up all night, hah, hah-hah-hah-hah
Bang, hard to say goodbye
You were my favorite thing 'til now
Bodies on the deck
Cold water is up your neck
Least loved will be there say, "Hi"

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, tell me why
You keep showing up in my dream
매일 밤 너를 찾던 그 시간에

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
In my wet nightmare
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Visit my wet night terror

[Verse 2]
Love got me haunted
Got me trapped in
Baby, got me stuck inside your heart
Your body got me drowning
Got me soaking
Baby, got me stuck inside your heart
You’re pretty even dying
Even ghosting
Pretty even 'cause you broke my heart
Love got you haunted
Got you trapped in
Baby, got you stuck inside my heart
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, tell me why
You keep showing up in my dream
매일 밤 너를 찾던 그 시간에

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
In my wet nightmare
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Visit my wet night terror

[Outro]
