[Intro]
I need you

[Chorus]
When my instinct hit me bad
Cryin' like some pussy cat on the bed
And when my instinct hit me sad
Mess around this whole town
'Cause I'm fucking mad

[Verse 1]
눈이 돌아 화가 나 나 나
거울 속에 비친 난 난 난
배를 곯은 산짐승 마냥
숨을 고르네, huh-huh-huh

[Pre-Chorus]
내가 거리로 나갈 때마다
사이렌이 울려 퍼지고
장총을 찬 젊은 남잔
날 잡겠다며 떵 떵 떵

[Chorus]
When my instinct hit me bad
Cryin' like some pussy cat on the bed
And when my instinct hit me sad
Mess around this whole town
'Cause I'm fucking mad

They wanna kill me and have me
At the same time
I'm the unlucky charm in this lil town
They might try to get rid of me in daylight
But they're crawlin' inside my bed
When night comes

[Chorus]
When my instinct hit me bad
Cryin' like somе pussy cat on the bed
And when my instinct hit mе sad
Mess around with this whole town
'Cause I'm fucking madEmbed
