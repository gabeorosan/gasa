Star in You - Wanting Qu
2 ContributorsStar in You LyricsThere is a star shining on you
Though it is far to reach but you refuse to stand still
Just when you feel like there’s no room to move
Know that you can bend a little to make it through
There’s a star in you
A star in me
Find the star within
Don’t wait till it’s too late, be the change you want to see
So the bar is raised, line is drawn for you
Would you rise above, go beyond or fall behind
Just when you feel like there’s no truth to prove
The essence of your will lies beneath the absence of your fear
There’s a star in you
A star in me
Find the star within
Don’t be your worse enemy; you are your best company
There’s a star in you
A star in me
Find the star within
Don’t wait till it’s too late, be the change you want to see
There is a star shining on you
There is a star shining on you
There is a star shining on you
Oh…
Start, to be believe
Start, to retrieve
Start, to achieve
Start, to dreamYou might also likeEmbed
