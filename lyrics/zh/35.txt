Shine Over Me - Wanting Qu
2 ContributorsShine Over Me LyricsI'm older than I am
I wish you were here
Who am I, who I am
Surrounded by empty spaces
I need love, well, who doesn't
Standing here
No tides no sand to drown my fears away
Oh oh...
And I'll wait, wait, wait for your love
And I'll give, give it all
There ain't no way, no way
The sun don't shine it hides away
So shine over me
It's inevitable
Everything around me changes even though I don't want them to
I will be looking forward to what tomorrow has in store for me
Standing here
No tides no sand to drown my fears away
Oh oh...
And I'll wait, wait, wait for your love
And I'll give, give it all
There ain't no way, no way
The sun don't shine it hides away
So shine over me
Crumbled heart...
Broken words...
I will face obstacles in life...
You might also likeAnd I'll wait, wait, wait for your love
And I'll give, give it all
There ain't no way, no way
The sun don't shine it hides away
So shine over me
There ain't no way, no way
The sun don't shine it hides away
So shine over me
So shine over meEmbed
