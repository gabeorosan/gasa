My Little Friend - Wanting Qu
1 ContributorMy Little Friend Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come sit with me, my little friend, help me understand
Why do they always want me to be what I can't become?
I try to make sense of it all
I know I can, I know I can
I try to jump and catch the ball
Even if I fall, even if I fall

[Chorus]
Every time I'm feeling down, I can hear you say
"Nothing is everything going to waste, don't throw it away, don't throw it away"
Every time I'm feeling small, about to hit a wall
I look into your eyes, suddenly I'm okay
I can count on you, I can count on you

[Verse 2]
I'll stand by you, my little friend, help you walk again
I'll give you a push and be there for you like you were there for me
I try my best not to disappoint
You know I'm better than that, yeah, I'm better than that
And if the world turns their back on me
I know you'll be right here next to me

[Chorus]
Every time I'm feeling down, I can hear you say
"Nothing is everything going to waste, don't throw it away, don't throw it away"
Every time I'm feeling small, about to hit a wall
I look into your eyes, suddenly I'm okay
I can count on you, I can count on you

I am sorry
When I'm in my own world, oh, I can be so cold
But you've always believed in me
Oh, ohâ€¨Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Every time I'm feeling down, I can hear you say
"Nothing is everything going to waste, don't throw it away, don't throw it away"
Every time I'm feeling small, about to hit a wall
I look into your eyes, suddenly I'm okay
I can count on you, I can count on you
Every time I'm feeling down, I can hear you say
"Nothing is everything going to waste, don't throw it away, don't throw it away"
Every time I'm feeling small, about to hit a wall
I look into your eyes, suddenly I'm okay
I can count on you, I can count on youEmbed
