You Like Me - Vicky Chen
1 ContributorYou Like Me Lyrics也许是我们的默契
说不出口要爱一辈子
没有承诺也没关系
互相摸索感情的样子

But we’re falling in love
And we’re falling in love
And we’re falling in love
How can we fall in love
When we don’t know what is love
We don’t know what is love

Don’t you say you don’t like me
Cause I don’t think I would believe it
Don’t you know that it’s likely
That we can find a way to make it
We can make it work
We can make it
We can make it work
Don’t you say you don’t like me
Cause I don’t think I would believe it

Cause I don’t think I would believe it

你说你会害怕自己喜欢上
我也同样害怕著 不想再重蹈覆彻
我们曾经都犯过傻 这次不想
但愿一切经历的 都让我们变更完整

And we’re falling in lovе
And we’re falling in love
How can we fall in love
When we don’t know what is love
We don’t know what is love

Don’t you say you don’t like me
Cause I don’t think I would believe it
Don’t you know that it’s likely
That we can find a way to make it
We can make it work
We can make it
We can make it work
Don’t you say you don’t like me
Cause I don’t think I would believe it

It happened that night when the lights were low
I told you if you let me I’ll rock your world
Kinda get the feeling that you’re down for it
But let’s wait for it
Take our time for it
Go, flow
And making it slow
Take in the joy with your mind and your soul
Come in and get it like Selena Go
I looked at your face like I’m on a roll
Don’t you say you don’t like me
Don’t you know that it’s likely

Don’t you say you don’t like me
Cause I don’t think I would believe it
Don’t you know that it’s likely
That we can find a way to make it

We can make it work
We can make it
We can make it work

Don’t you say you don’t like me
Cause I don’t think I would believe itEmbed
