Time, My Friend - Wanting Qu
1 ContributorTime, My Friend Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dreaming in illusion I don't want to
Live in the fears of emptiness
Feeling no emotion, no desire
But wanting a hand to hold on to

[Pre-Chorus]
Time once again healed my wounds and laughed
She says, "Now you see what happened at last?
Never underestimate your strength, my lady
Don't give up, don't give up
Never give in, never give in"

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ha
Ooh-ooh-ah, ha-ha

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Listening to the rain I got over
This misery they called "loneliness"
Goodbye desolation, I'm kicking the habit
Breathing like I was a newborn again
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Time once again healed my wounds and laughed
She says now, "Now you see what happened at last?
Never underestimate your strength, my lady
Don't give up, don't give up
Never give in, never give in"

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ha
Ooh-ooh-ah, ha-ha-oh
Ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ah, ha-ha

[Post-Chorus]
Time is my good friend
Take a walk now hand in hand
Time is my good friend
Take a walk, hand in hand
Time is my good friend
Take a walk now hand in hand, yeah
Time is my good friend
Take a walk, hand in hand, yeah

[Bridge]
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh (Rock me, baby)
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh (Rock me, baby)
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
Time offered my hand and she said to me
As long as you're breathing, I'll be here my friend"

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ha
Ooh-ooh-ah, ha-ha
Ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ah, ha-ha

[Outro]
Time is my good friend
Take a walk now hand in hand, yeah
Time is my good friend
Take a walk, hand in hand
(Time is my good friend)
(Take a walk now hand in hand)
(Time is my good friend)
(Take a walk, hand in hand)
(Time is my good friend)
(Take a walk now hand in hand)
