1 ContributorWouldn’t It Be Nice Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Wouldn't it be nice to break without breaking you?
Wouldn't it be nice to choose without losing you?
Wouldn't it be nice to know that you're honest too?
Wouldn't it be nice if it didn't hurt the way I do?

[Verse]
So hard to breathe Sometimes it feels like all this is not free
You're on my lips [?]
Tell me that you're feeling, tell me that you're feeling it, feeling it too (Oh-ah, oh-ah)

[Chorus]
But wouldn't it be nice to break without breaking you? (Wouldn't it be nice, wouldn't, wouldn't, wouldn't it be nice?)
Wouldn't it be nice to choose without losing you? (Wouldn't it be nice, wouldn't, wouldn't, wouldn't it be nice?)
Wouldn't it be nice to know that you're honest too? (Wouldn't it be nice, wouldn't, wouldn't, wouldn't it be nice?)
Wouldn't it be nice, wouldn't it be nice, wouldn't it be nice
If it didn't hurt, if it didn't hurt, if it didn't hurt, the way I do?

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Wouldn't it be nice to love like I've loved you before?
Wouldn't it be nice to end without starting a war?
