You Can’t Hurt Me Anymore - Wanting Qu
1 ContributorYou Can’t Hurt Me Anymore Lyrics[Verse 1]
I look in the mirror
Your lash showing through
Told me that lie, got so much to prove
And broken my spirit, you're pinning these scars, burned by fire
Then you stole my spark (Leave me like this)

[Pre-Chorus]
Throw your stones, I'll turn them into stardust
I build the broken heart of armor

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me anymore, oh-oh-oh
You can't hurt me anymore, oh-oh-oh
A heart has died a thousand times before, oh-oh
You can't hurt me anymore, oh-oh-oh
(You can't hurt me now)

[Verse 2]
Said I was fragile, made out of glass
But I'm a diamond, if you try me
Yeah, you find that diamonds never crack (Crack)
Step out of my way, for you're history to me now

[Chorus]
You can't hurt mе anymore, oh-oh-oh
You can't hurt me anymore, oh-oh-oh
A hеart has died a thousand times before, oh-oh
You can't hurt me anymore, oh-oh-oh
(You can't hurt me now)

You can't hurt me anymore (You can't, you can't, you can't hurt me now)
Oh-oh-oh (You can't, you can't, you can't hurt me now, you can't, you can't, you can't hurt me now)
