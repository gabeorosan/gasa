Sing For You - Wanting Qu
1 ContributorSing For You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't want to fall asleep tonight
'Cause I fear the world I wake up to
Is one without you
Every time I close my eyes
I don't wanna dream if dreaming is without you

[Chorus]
Don't let it die, don't let it go
Don't wanna face the world alone
I can't make it on my own
I'll wait for you, it brings me hope
I know that you'll be coming home
Till that day, I'll sing for you

[Verse 2]
I long for your touch
I long for our crazy conversations
You make it easy to be wild and free
I try to make terms with time
"Can we all just stay like this and let's not go anywhere?" (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Don't let it die, don't let it go
Don't wanna face the world alone
I can't make it on my own
I'll wait for you, it brings me hope
I know that you'll be coming home
Till that day, I'll sing for you
You might also like[Bridge]
I'll think of you (You)
I'll learn from you (You)
I'll send my love, to follow you
I just can't hide from you
I can't run from you
I wanna start with you
I'm in love with you

[Chorus]
Don't let it die, don't let it go
Don't wanna face the world alone
I can't make it on my own
I'll wait for you, it brings me hope
I know that you'll be coming home
Till that day, I'll sing for you
Don't let it die, don't let it go
Don't wanna face the world alone
I can't make it on my own
I'll wait for you, it brings me hope
I know that you'll be coming home
Till that day, I'll sing for you
Until that day, I'll sing for youEmbed
