Hideaway - Wanting Qu
2 ContributorsHideaway LyricsYou don’t ask much, but when you do
It’s always sincere and true
You don’t talk much, but when you do
It’s rarely about you, but I can still learn something new
You know I’m gonna love you all the way
Though these three little words I never hear you say
I’m ready when you are
It’s not too late to start
I never wanna be apart
But we are, without love
I know you’re ready yes you are
Because the red is in your heart
I know you’ll never be too far away
Because I’m your baby and you’re my hide away
You don’t argue, but when you do
You always have good reasons to
You don’t break down, but the day you did
My heart dropped to the ground
So I stood there and cried along
You know I’m gonna love you all the way
Though these three little words I never hear you say
I’m ready when you are
It’s not too late to start
I never wanna be apart
But we are, without love
I know you’re ready yes you are
Because the red is in your heart
I know you’ll never be too far away
Because I’m your baby and you’re my hide away
You know it’s gonna take a lot to push me away
But time is running out I need to hear you say
I’m ready when you are
It’s not too late to start
I never wanna be apart
But we are, without love
I know you’re ready yes you are
Because the red is in your heart
I know you’ll never be too far away
Because I’m your baby and you’re my hide away
I’m ready when you are (Repeat)
I know you’ll never be too far away because I’m your baby and you’re my hide away
I know you’ll never be too far away because I’m your baby and you’re my hide awayYou might also likeEmbed
