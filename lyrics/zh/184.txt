1 ContributorJoker Needs Laughter Too Lyrics[Verse 1]
Joker has left the room, there's no fun to poke
He left with a smile and a heart of gold
What did he take with him? Where is he going?

[Chorus]
Joker needs laughter too
Joker needs laughter too
Nah, nah, nah, joker needs laughter

[Verse 2]
Joker stumbles easily just like you and me
But he tries to hide his feet, so we couldnâ€™t see
And he waits so patiently for an indication

[Chorus]
Joker needs laughter too
Joker needs laughter too
(Nah, nah, nah) Joker needs laughter too
Nah, nah, nah, joker needs laughter too, ooh-whoa
Joker needs laughter

[Bridge]
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
