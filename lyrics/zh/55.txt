Your Girl (婷兒) - Wanting Qu
1 ContributorYour Girl (婷兒) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your name gives it away
You're my sun and my moon, the bright light of my every day
And I was your girl, still am your girl
Until the end of time

[Chorus]
And I will write this song, sing this song, play this song for you
Can you hear me over there?
I'm dying over here
And I will fight for you, pray for you, cry for you, I got love for you
I don't care what people say
I don't care what people say
I'll always be your girl

[Verse 2]
Still remember the time
Had that bad dream again
You held me close, got me through the night
Just give me a chance, to show you the world and evеrything that's beautiful

[Chorus]
I will write this song, sing this song, play this song for you
Can you hear mе over there?
I'm dying over here
And I will fight for you pray for you, cry for you, I got love for you
I don't care what people say
I don't care what people say
I'll always be your girl

You taught me wrong from right
It's never black or white
But through the lies, truth is what you'll find
Didn't always see eye to eye, but still you sacrificed
You took the fall to watch me fly

[Chorus]
And I will write this song, sing this song play, this song for you (For you, for you)
Can you hear me over there?
I'm dying over here
And I will fight for you, pray for you, cry for you, I got love for you
I don't care what people say
I don't care what people say
I'll always be your girl, oh
I'll always be your girl

[Post-Chorus]
Always your girl
Forever your girl
One and only girl
I'll always be, forever be, your one and only girlEmbed
