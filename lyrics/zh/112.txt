Where—where did you go, where?
Oh
Where—where did you go, where?
Oh
Where—where did you go, where?

[主歌一]
曾看着同星空
闲聊吹风
看日出多心动
曾每日缠一起 傻傻讲起
能爱到下世纪
怎么你俘虏这个心
却抽身退隐
不再亲近
独自苦等
仍然空等
难藏泪印
看着电话中短讯
听著录音的口讯
昨天的你哪天再接近?

[副歌]
Tell me where did you go
Where did you hide? (Tell me)
Where did you go?
数数多久不碰到?
Oh-oh 爱在每夜 彻夜狂想:
"Where did you go?"
Ooh

这夜月光中 再见影踪
再献花多感动
而似蜜甜的心 明明开心
为何又骤降温?
怎么你一下子抱紧
却一下子转身 不再亲近
独自苦等 仍然空等 难藏泪印
看着电话中短讯
听著录音的口讯
昨天的你哪天再接近?

[副歌]
Tell me where did you go (Ooh)
Where did you hide? (Tell me)
Tell me where did you go?
数数多久不碰到?
Oh-oh 爱在每夜 彻夜狂想:
"Oh, where did you go?"
Oh, where did you go?

[过门]
怎会当这刻我需要你
你却没在我身边
Oh, where did you go?
Where did you go?
这秒钟很挂牵 你却不可感觉到
Oh, where did you go?
Ooh, oh, yeah
Tell me where did you go?
心声都不可细诉
Oh, tell me, baby, where did you hide
辛苦都未被谅解
Where did you go?
数数多久不碰到
Oh-oh 我在每夜彻夜狂想
Where did you go?
[结局]
Where—where did you go, where? (Tell me)
Oh
Where—where did you go, where?
Oh
Where—where did you go, where? (Tell me)
Oh
Where—where did you go, where?
Where did you go?Embed
