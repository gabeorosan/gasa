If You’re Really Gonna Leave Me - Vicky Chen
1 ContributorIf You’re Really Gonna Leave Me LyricsI’m feeling all alone when I’m with you
Cause the feeling’s gone I don’t know what to do to help you through this
Cause you used to walk and hold my hand
Now you’re always running off ahead
And you left me all alone when I’m with you

If you’re really gonna leave me
And I don’t speak up, and I just let go then
Is there anyone who sees me
Right down to my bones and into my soul?
Cause I used to think this thing between us meant we’d be together forever but
If you’re really gonna leave me
Thеn I guess this love is just like all thе rest

Now I know I’m going nowhere when I’m with you
Cause we’re going round in circles don’t know just how to break us out this loop
And we used to laugh and talk for hours now it’s silence mixed with awkward smiles
Cause I know I’m going nowhere when I’m with you

If I’m really gonna leave ya
And you don’t speak up, and you just let go then
Is there anyone who sees ya
Right down to your bones and into your soul
Cause we used to think this thing between us meant we’d be together forever but
If I’m really gonna leave ya
Then I guess this love is just like all the rest
Then I guess this love is just like all the rest
Then I guess this love is just like all the restYou might also likeEmbed
