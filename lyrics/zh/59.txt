[Verse]
Let me distract you in the morning
Let me distract you in the evening
Whatever it takes to keep you high

Let me distract you when you're sleeping
Until we synchronize our breathing
Whatever it takes to keep you high
I'm in it for life, my ride or die

So let me concentrate on you (Woo)
Sit back, relax, watch me move (Woo)
Got you so mеssed up on my love
You know you can't leavе, won't leave, don't leave

Anything you want
I can give it to you
You can have it all, (Woo) have it all, have it all, all, all, all, all
Anything you want
I can give it to you
You can have it all, (Woo) have it all, have it all, all, all, all, all
