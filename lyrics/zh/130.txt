Get Over You (簡體字/Simplified Characters) - 鄧紫棋
2 ContributorsTranslationsChinese TraditionalRomanizationGet Over You (簡體字/Simplified Characters) Lyrics[主歌一]
曾在月光之下望烟花
曾共看夕阳渐降下
要怎么将一切放下
我怎么舍得去放下
曾在风中漫步沙滩
曾在烛光里共晚饭
记起当天温暖对白
这一刻发觉太偏差

[副歌]
I wanna get over you
Tell me what I have to do
提醒过自己删掉记忆统统不记起
I wanna get over you
But I just cannot make it through
怎么可怎么可心死
How do I get over you?

[主歌二]
仍自欺于旧日之间
仍未信热茶易冷淡
我根本不想要放下
你怎么狠心要放下
现在深宵独自瑟缩
在已弃置无人空屋
你最终都要走
唯独我不太愿接受

[过门]
想等他转身我太天真
想更加抱紧却更伤心
想过抽了身无奈我戒不起心瘾
想找一个人随便接近
将这一个心填密缺憾
不过竟更加怀念你昨天一吻, whoa
