(Ha)
Baby, won't you come on over?
Lay your head on my shoulder
Tell me how your day was, chill little more, let's get a little closer
Shoutout all the haters, from the mob like the paper
Got me feeling that buzz, got me spun, left drunk, losing my composure

[Pre-Chorus]
We are on top of the world right now
Don't never ever let me down
'Cause I feel safe and sound in your arms

[Chorus]
(You got me feeling) Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow, give me morе
(You lift me up, lift me up, lift me up now) (Givе me more)
(You got me feeling) Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow, give me more
(You lift me up, lift me up, lift me up now) (Give me more)

[Verse 2]
I'll diffuse when I'm [?]
Hate this guy when I'm tempted
I can make you skip work, you come first to the work, baby, if you let me
We get lost in the madness, you're so good, you're the baddest
'Cause you been on my lips, like I put my neck kiss, baby, come and get me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
We are on top of the world right now
I won't never ever let you down
You're always safe and sound in my arms (In my arms)

[Chorus]
(You got me feeling) Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow, give me more
(You lift me up, lift me up, lift me up now) (Give me more)
(You got me feeling) Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow, give me more
(You lift me up, lift me up, lift me up now) (Give me more)

[Bridge]
[?] but heaven is only for two
You set my heart on fire, now it's burning for you
'Cause this love is timeless, we're written in stone
Forever afterglow, forever afterglow
(Afterglow, afterglow)

[Chorus]
(You got me feeling) Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow, give me more
(You lift me up, lift me up, lift me up now) (Give me more)
(You got me feeling) Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow, give me more
(You lift me up, lift me up, lift me up now) (Give me more)
Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow, give me more
(You lift me up, lift me up, lift me up now) (Give me more)
(You got me feeling) Afterglow, afterglow
Afterglow, afterglow (Ooh-ooh)
