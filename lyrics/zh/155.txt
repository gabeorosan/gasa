Everything In The World - Wanting Qu
2 ContributorsEverything In The World LyricsHow many times you asked yourself before?
What's the point wasting time
But how many times you stand up for yourself?
Make a point, you have a reason

You know it's not fair
Your life belongs to nobody else

So don't tell me there is nobody you want to hold
You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
So don't tell me there is nothing left in this world
Just open your eyes, you got everything in the world

How many times you want to give up yourself?
Once again, there's no point
But how many times you kept on moving on?
Once again, there's a reason

You know it's not fair
Your life belongs to nobody else

So don't tell me there is nobody you want to hold
You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
So don't tell me there is nothing left in this world
Just open your eyes, you got everything in the world

Is it you, or is it me? Oh, does it really make you falter?
Does it make you want to believe?
It is true, you're like nobody else

So don't tell me there is nobody you want to hold
You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
So don't tell me there is nothing left in this world
Just open your eyes, you got everything in the world
Just open your eyes, you got everything in the world
I open my eyes, I have you in my worldEmbed
