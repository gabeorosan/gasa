1 ContributorPop Culture LyricsGimme the TNT
The timer goes here
Think instructions said the green wire goes with the clear
Now where's that detonator
I had it somewhere
Amazing how this button will lift bodies in the air
All in the name of God
All for the love of Him
Must kill whoever worships otherwise that is sin
Went to that night class
Got recruited quick
Get the chance to save my people when I get to light the wick
I submit to him
So I have right to kill
Never mind He holds the gavel of this life and death it's still
All in my head for him
All for my Muslims
Cause really only ever taking lives will solve problems
And the world will see
My face on tv
And when I get to heaven my virgins will wait for me
I think I'm justified
I hope it's not all lies
Wait... if Islam means peace pulling a piece may not be right

I cannot be seen
I cannot be heard
If he sees my skin, I'll be cast to hell for sure
I am not worth
I am not equal
My beauty isn't relevant, it's frowned upon as evil
I must not speak
Unless I'm spoken to
I stay in the kitchen stay reserved in servitude
Thus I serve to him
Thus I serve to you
Then back to the kitchen I ain't welcome in the room
I take all the pain
I suffer from within
If all praises due to God why do I take orders from him?
He is not Devine
He is not exalted
My lord is watching down on me I know that he's insulted
You might also likeDrop a couple bombs
Get everyone to hate you
Would you believe me if I told you that I share the feelings they do?
If you ain't help the problem then you just as much a part of it
We making all the wrongs seem right every time we pardon it
Jihad isn't holy war who gave you the right to call on it
Islam is peace and beauty our duty is just to follow it
Now where in that description do you read women are lesser than
I read that at your mothers feet you the closest to heaven man
Saying bismillah before pullin the pin dont make it right
Or I could stick my fork in pork and take a vodka shot tonight
I hate when they say we waged war, I don't support their choices
Extremist of religion don't speak for the humble and voiceless
If that was true then I'd say you just pay the church to say what's right
Let your people walk through lands beheading who won't bow to Christ
Rewrite the written just to rid of spouses you don't want as wife
But that ain't you though that was them I know so why let them rep my...
Religion shouldn't be based on decisions of a few lost men
The cover of the book don't always really tell what's held within
So flip to CBC, see what they covering on CNN
But take it with a grain of salt cause that ain't us that ain't Muslim

It's this
Pop culture on my mind
Everybody in it, grape vines intertwined
Everybody lost in it in their own mind
Every time I feel like getting out, confined
The stereo is typical that line defined
By whatever is shown, minds' eye gone blind
The hour glass is tipping, slipping, running out of time
Gripping for the edge but rock bottom's hard to climbEmbed
