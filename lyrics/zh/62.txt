Time, My Friend (Remix) - Wanting Qu
2 ContributorsTime, My Friend (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Wanting]
Dreaming in illusion I don't want to
Live in the fears of emptiness
Feeling no emotion, no desire
But wanting a hand to hold on to

[Pre-Chorus: Wanting]
Time once again healed my wounds and laughed
She says, "Now you see what happened at last?
Never underestimate your strength, my lady
Don't give up, don't give up
Never give in, never give in"

[Chorus: Wanting]
Ooh-ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ha
Ooh-ooh-ah, ha-ha

[Post-Chorus: Wanting]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Wanting]
Listening to the rain I got over
This misery they called "loneliness"
Goodbye desolation, I'm kicking the habit
Brеathing like I was a newborn again
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Wanting]
And time oncе again healed my wounds and laughed
She says now, "Now you see what happened at last?
Never underestimate your strength, my lady
Don't give up, don't give up
Never give in, never give in"

[Chorus: Wanting]
Ooh-ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ha
Ooh-ooh-ah, ha-ha-oh
Ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ah, ha-ha

[Post-Chorus: Wanting & Far East Movement]
Time is my good friend
Take a walk now hand in hand
Time is my good friend
Take a walk, hand in hand
Time is my good friend
Take a walk now hand in hand, yeah
Time is my good friend
Take a walk, hand in hand, yeah

[Verse 3: Far East Movement]
Yeah, the only thing I'm never wasting and it never accepts my payment
So I've been trying to bribe God for little more
But I might die waiting, when the hard times fall like sand
Rebirth comes while I'm pacing and I got more patience than 'em plastic surgeons out in Vegas
My time has been effaced if I was smiling while I'm making earthquake in this freaking faking world too unique I'm Kevin Bacon
Until then, I'm appreciating every moment waking 'cause time's been good to me, retrograde
True that, 'cause we be traveling history (Ya) double parking our DeLorean, throw it back, our favorite tracks to hear what the sound of glory is (Woo)
To the little Beastie Boys, OutKast, 2Pac, Notorious (Ha)
My music don't run out until the story ends, (Mm-mm) brutality
[Bridge: Wanting]
Time offered my hand and she said to me
As long as you're breathing, I'll be here my friend"

[Chorus: Wanting & Far East Movement]
Ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ha
Ooh-ooh-ah, ha-ha
Ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ah-ooh-ah, ha-ha

[Outro: Wanting & Far East Movement]
Time is my good friend
Take a walk now hand in hand, yeah
Time is my good friend
Take a walk, hand in hand
(Time is my good friend)
(Take a walk now hand in hand)
(Time is my good friend)
(Take a walk, hand in hand)
(Time is my good friend)
(Take a walk now hand in hand)
(Time is my good friend)Embed
