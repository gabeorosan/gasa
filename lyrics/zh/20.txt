Drenched - Wanting Qu
1 ContributorDrenched Lyrics[Verse 1]
When minutes become hours
When days become years
And I don't know where you are
Colour seems so dull without you

[Pre-Chorus]
Have we lost our minds? What have we done?
But it all doesn't seem to matter anymore

[Chorus]
When you kissed me on that street
I kissed you back
You held me in your arms, I held you in mine
You picked me up to lay me down
When I look into your eyes
I can hear you cry for a little bit more of you
And I, I'm drenched in your love
I'm no longer able to hold it back

[Verse 2]
Is it too late to ask for love?
Is it wrong to feel right?
When the world is winding down
Thoughts of you linger around
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Have we lost our minds? What have we done?
But it all doesn't seem to matter anymore

[Chorus]
When you kissed me on that street
I kissed you back
You held me in your arms, I held you in mine
You picked me up to lay me down
When I look into your eyes
I can hear you cry for a little bit more of you
And I, I'm drenched in your love
I'm no longer able to hold it back

When you kissed me on that street
I kissed you back
You held me in your arms, I held you in mine
You picked me up to lay me down
When I look into your eyes
I can hear you cry for a little bit more of you
And I, I'm drenched in your love
I'm no longer able to hold it backEmbed
