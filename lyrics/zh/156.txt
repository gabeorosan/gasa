1 ContributorLife Is Like a Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you know the way you walk
The way you talk, the way you say "I'd love to"
It makes me feel alive
Do you know the way you run your fingers through my hair
And I'm with you now

[Chorus]
Life is like a…
Life is like a song
Sing along
On and on and on, it lingers on
Come along
Piece together phrases in a funny way
Life is like a song

[Verse 2]
It was a rainy day, I got you on the phone
How do you do? It's been a while or two, a while or two
Suddenly, the clouds had disappeared
Love is kind, love is blind
I don't mind being your lover's fool

[Chorus]
Life is like a…
Life is like a song
Sing along
On and on and on, it lingers on
Come along
Piece together phrases in a funny way
Life is like a song
Life is like a song

Life is like a song
It has its ups and downs
Oh, life is like a song
And it carries us on, oh
It is like a song
On and on and on

[Outro]
Life is like a song
And it has its ups and downs
And it carries us on, oh
Life is like a…
Life is like a…
Life is like a…
Life is like a…
