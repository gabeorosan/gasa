Say The Words - Wanting Qu
1 ContributorSay The Words Lyrics[Verse 1]
When was the last time, you said these words
To the ones you deeply care for, you know they care for you too
So let's all say the words, I will count to three
One and two and three, I love you

[Verse 2]
I have a mother, she was a very strict mother
And I was a red bull, made her life a living hell
But I'm not like that anymore, I want to make her smile
So I'd like to take this moment and say the words

[Chorus]
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

[Verse 3]
I have a father, he doesn't talk much
He is one of those, the quiet types
You can barely get the word out of him
But I know deep that inside he loves me so
So I'd like to take this moment and say the words

[Chorus]
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
You might also like[Verse 4]
I have my friends I could tell them everything, but
How come I haven't told 'em how much they mean to me?
Is it because of the society restraining us from being free
So I'd like to take this moment and say the words

[Chorus]
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

[Verse 5]
I have my ex-boyfriends, we don't talk anymore
But I never stop wishing them happiness and joy
They were big part of my life and made me who I am today
So I'd like to take this moment and say the words

[Chorus]
I thank you, (Haha) I thank you
I thank you, I thank you

[Verse 6]
I have a pet, her name is Tiffany
She's a 7-year-old domestic cat, pretending she is me
But she always cheers me up when I look into her pretty eyes
So I'd like to take this moment and say the words
[Chorus]
Meow meow meow, meow meow meow
Meow meow meow, meow meow meow

[Verse 7]
So many people in this world doing what they can
To make a difference every day, so we all be here to stay
Some of them will be heroes, but some of them will never be heard
So I'd like to take this moment and say the words

[Chorus]
I thank you, I thank you
I thank you, I thank you

[Verse 8]
So this is near the end of this song, I hope you feel the love
It's not the typical song I write, but it's coming from the heart
If you haven't said these words, then what the hell are you waiting for?
Because it never hurts to say these words

[Chorus]
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you (Everybody)
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
[Verse 1]
So when was the last time, you said these words
To the ones you deeply care for, you know they care for you too
So let's all say the words, I will count to three
One and two and three, I love youEmbed
