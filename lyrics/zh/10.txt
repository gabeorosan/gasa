1 ContributorG.E.M. - 平行世界 (”English Translation” Parallel World Parallel) LyricsLosing you, I've forgotten how the sky used to be blue
Unable to find you, that's why I hid my eyes under my hood
But if you could not hear me anymore, why bother?
Who would want to wander?
But if you're not there, where would be my destination?

My last string of hope is if you and I were to meet again
In that parallel universe
Maybe we could rewrite our story

If you and I were to meet again
Could we rewrite our story once again?

You feel from the sky, as beautiful as a meteor showеr
You took me by surprise, you werе gone before I make my wish
Why are roses red?
Because pain always come to those who has ever loved before
Watchfully wait upon the night sky, hopeful to catch a glimpse of you

My last string of hope is if you and I were to meet again
In that parallel universe
Maybe we could rewrite our story

If you and I were to meet again
Could we rewrite our story once again?
You might also likeI'm haunted by my thoughts of you
I'm chastised by them day and night
But I try my best to fight against the disappointments
Not allowing them to devour me

My last string of hope is if you and I were to meet again
In that parallel universe
Maybe we could

My last string of hope is if you and I were to meet again
In that parallel universe
Maybe we could rewrite our story

Last string of hope
Is in that parallel universe1Embed
