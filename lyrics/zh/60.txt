Kissing Paradise - Wanting Qu
1 ContributorKissing Paradise Lyrics[Verse 1]
You keep on talking, I'll give you something to feel on (Yeah)
We keep it moving synonymous with the neon (Yeah)
Everybody wish they on the level that we on (Mm) (Yeah)
Wrist and neck all frozen like I've been sipping Freon, yeah (Yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause it's like
You and I
We could die
Who wants to live a million lives?
When we're up so high
We're already kissing paradise
We're already kissing paradise
We're already kissing paradise, yeah

[Verse 2]
My body's screaming, let's start up a conversation (Yeah)
Don't think about it, just use your imagination (Yeah)
It's getting wavy, you're taking me on vacation (Yeah)
This feels like heaven 'cause, baby, we got it A1, yeah (Yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause it's like
You and I
We could die
Who wants to live a million lives? (Paradise)
When we're up so high
We're already kissing paradise
We're already kissing paradise
We're already kissing paradise

[Bridge]
Take me all the way, just take it to the edge
Take my breath away until there's nothing left (Eh, eh)
Take me all the way, just take me on a ride
When you're here with me I'm kissing paradise

[Chorus]
'Cause it's like
You and I
We could die
Who wants to live a million lives? (Paradise)
When we're up so high
We're already kissing paradise (Wanna tell me, babe) (Oh, oh) (Wanna tell me, babe)
