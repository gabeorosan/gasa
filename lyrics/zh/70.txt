Where—where did you go, where?
Oh
Where—where did you go, where?
Oh
Where—where did you go, where?

[主歌一]
曾看著同星空
閑聊吹風
看日出多心動
曾每日纏一起 傻傻講起
能愛到下世紀
怎麼你俘虜這個心
卻抽身退隱
不再親近
獨自苦等
仍然空等
難藏淚印
看著電話中短訊
聽著錄音的口訊
昨天的你哪天再接近?

[副歌]
Tell me where did you go
Where did you hide? (Tell me)
Where did you go?
數數多久不碰到?
Oh-oh 愛在每夜 徹夜狂想:
"Where did you go?"
Ooh

這夜月光中 再見影蹤
再獻花多感動
而似蜜甜的心 明明開心
為何又驟降溫?
怎麼你一下子抱緊
卻一下子轉身 不再親近
獨自苦等 仍然空等 難藏淚印
看著電話中短訊
聽著錄音的口訊
昨天的你哪天再接近?

[副歌]
Tell me where did you go (Ooh)
Where did you hide? (Tell me)
Tell me where did you go?
數數多久不碰到?
Oh-oh 愛在每夜 徹夜狂想:
"Oh, where did you go?"
Oh, where did you go?

[過門]
怎會當這刻我需要你
你卻沒在我身邊
Oh, where did you go?
Where did you go?
這秒鐘很掛牽 你卻不可感覺到
Oh, where did you go?
Ooh, oh, yeah
Tell me where did you go?
心聲都不可細訴
Oh, tell me, baby, where did you hide
辛苦都未被諒解
Where did you go?
數數多久不碰到
Oh-oh 我在每夜徹夜狂想
Where did you go?
[結局]
Where—where did you go, where? (Tell me)
Oh
Where—where did you go, where?
Oh
Where—where did you go, where? (Tell me)
Oh
Where—where did you go, where?
Where did you go?Embed
