What Have U Done - 鄧紫棋

Hey, oh, yeah
明明你我呼吸裡都帶氧份
明明你我身份理應對等
為何要我吞聲氣忍你過份
為何你眼睛總看不見人
若沒學歷地位怎表態
你眼中要幾多幾多身家先參拜
你那天秤一早已歪
標準怎理解
低踩高攀是什麼心態

[副歌]
請你別要太放任
舊日我沒呼叫別當我笨
極沒法容忍再被困
就此釋放怒憤
這刻要換你悔恨
So what have you done? (You done, you done, you done)
What have you done? (You done, you done, you done)
What have you done?  (You done, you done, you done)
What have you done?  (You done, you done, you done)
What have you done?  (You done, you done, you done)

[主歌二]
明明你我只不過差了姓名
明明你我身份証都有星
為何沒戴真皮已彷似缺憾
為何著對高踭會高過人
權力或待遇用什麼收買
你到底要幾多幾多身家先參拜
你那天秤一早已歪
標準怎理解
低踩高攀是什麼心態

[過門]
受夠面口
官腔早不太入流
白領紅頸
左轉前方找出口
Oh-oh, yeah
