Nobody’s Fault - Wanting Qu
2 ContributorsNobody’s Fault LyricsI must be crazy Now you'd understand
That sure that you lied to me was made out of sight
Oh love should be easy but I think otherwise
And it's kind of silly I thought I'd figure it out

Everything is possible
But it's a wrong statement after all
We are each other's trouble but it's nobody's fault
And it's nobody's fault

And I remember watching sad movies alone
I would cry and cry, cry and cry as the end of credits roll
Until the end this is no one could see
No need to hide, I could be me

Everything is possible
But it's a wrong statement after all
We are each other's trouble but it's nobody's fault

Who is right, who is wrong
Who is still standing nearby
Love or hate, you know I'd rather not debate
When is one and one, is both good now

Everything is possible
But it's a wrong statement after all
We are each other's trouble but it's nobody's fault

But it's a wrong statement after all
We are each other's trouble but it's nobody's fault
And it's nobody's fault

We are each other's trouble but it's nobody's fault
And it's nobody's faultEmbed
