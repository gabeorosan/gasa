Lover (Live) - 鄧紫棋
2 ContributorsLover (Live) LyricsYesterday was a pretty big day for me
This time around I found someone who gets me
I'm going home with you tonight
If you give me your heart, I'll never miss a beat
The words fall out of my mouth
But I never really had it until now
Never wanna get out of bed with me
What do you have to lose?
I'd imagine there's at least one or two
Reasons why you can't be mine
Trust me, I can barely believe my eyes
I can't believe my eyes
I can't believe my eyes
So today, I just got and had enough to leave
When you're far away, makes me sad, oh
We go together so naturally
Blessed whatever was said we hadn't missed a beat
Tell me what you want to do
I just want to be with you
And get you back into bed
What do you have to lose?
I'd imagine there's at least one or two
Reasons why you can't be mine
Trust me, I can barely believe my eyes
I can't believe my eyes
I can't believe my eyes
I can't believe that you still stay here with me
Despite the mess that I am
I can't believe you're mine to have and to hold
I swear it doesn't get old
Say what you want, I'm sold
What do you have to lose?
I'd imagine there's at least one or two
Reasons why you can't be mine
Trust me, I can barely believe my eyes
I can't believe my eyes
I can't believe my eyesYou might also likeEmbed
