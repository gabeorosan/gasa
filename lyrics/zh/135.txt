Who I Am - Vicky Chen
2 ContributorsWho I Am Lyrics再温暖的时光 都已成为过往
留不住的年华 会变什么模样
爱不爱自己 能不能活得坦荡
聆听著心中的声响

And It’s okay to be afraid
But I need you to trust me for who I am
When it all fades, won’t be the same
And I need you to trust me for who I am

Who I am
Who I am
Who I am
Who I am

And It’s okay to be afraid
But I need you to trust me for who I am

轻轻放在手上 是活著的重量
慢慢懂得扛下 在心中的渴望
要面对心底 那不快乐的模样
才不会被自己捆绑

And It’s okay to be afraid
But I need you to trust me for who I am
When it all fades, won’t be the same
And I need you to trust me for who I am
You might also likeWho I am
Who I am
Who I am
Who I am

And It’s okay to be afraid
But I need you to trust me for who I am

When everything goes crazy and the feeling fades away
And I’m lost and trapped in my head, yeah I’ll be okay
Cause I always get there somehow, and I always face the pain
And I’ll keep it up forever it’s just who I amEmbed
