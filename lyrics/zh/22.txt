Love Struck Me Down - Wanting Qu
2 ContributorsLove Struck Me Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm going back to the sunset strip
A place I fell in love with a man
I know I had to see him again
So I drove a thousand miles in a day
Fourteen hours seemed like a piece of cake
'Cause I know in the end the price was worth the fight

[Pre-Chorus]
There he was, standing with his puzzled eyes
Then he closed the gaps between us, lips inches away

[Chorus]
Suddenly love struck me down
My knees hit the ground
He loved me back
Like it was yesterday
Oh, love struck me down
I weep but no sound
A long awaited love struck me down

[Verse 2]
It's been three years since you left town
How've you been? I hope life didn't bring you down
You must have met someone like me by now
Sunday morning I was in bed
Let the phone ring, but it wouldn't end
I was mad, I picked up, it was you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
"Hey you, I am back for good now"
Then it brought me back to that day, your lips inches away (Oh)

[Chorus]
Suddenly love struck me down
My knees hit the ground
He loved me back
Like it was yesterday
Oh, love struck me down
I weep but no sound
A long awaited love struck me down

[Bridge]
Just ask me to stay
I'll stay for the night
There's nowhere else I rather be than here with your body next to mine
Holding me tight
Back into your arms

[Chorus]
Love struck me down
My knees hit the ground
He loved me back
Like it was yesterday
Oh, love struck me down
I weep but no sound
A long awaited love struck me down
A long awaited love struck me down
A long awaited love struck me downEmbed
