Life Is A Struggle - Wanting Qu
1 ContributorLife Is A Struggle Lyrics[Chorus]
Life is a struggle, I'm not the only one
Love is a tangle and I'm not the only one
Everyone grows old and I'm not the only one
Then why the hell am I still feeling so alone?

[Verse 1]
Once again I'm at a crossroads
Wondering which way I should go
If I go, will it take me home?
In my heart I, I know

[Chorus]
Life is a struggle, I'm not the only one
Love is a tangle and I'm not the only one
Everyone grows old, I'm not the only one
Then why the hell am I still feeling so alone?

[Verse 2]
Once again I'm hanging by a thread
Wondering if I should have my eyes closed
Before I cut my safety rope
In my heart I know

[Chorus]
Life is a struggle, I'm not the only one
Love is a tangle and I'm not the only one
Everyone grows old and I'm not the only one
Then why the hell am I still feeling so?
How am I still feeling so?
Why the hell am I still feeling so alone? Alone
Life is a struggle, I'm not the only one
Love is a tangle, I'm not the only one
Everybody wants to have someone to hold
Then why the hell am I still feeling so?
How am I still feeling so?
Why the hell am I still feeling so alone?

Life is a struggle, ooh
Love is a tangle, oh
Everyone grows old and I'm not the only one
Then why the hell am I still alone?Embed
