Painted A Picture - Vicky Chen
1 ContributorPainted A Picture LyricsI painted a picture, when I first got with you
But that beautiful picture
We both know it ain’t truth
在完美的世界 不用說再見 不用掉眼淚
從來不受限 我們的時間 彌留在人間

一個個的傷疤 還以為自己會有所成長
傷疤不在身上 都狠狠地刻在別人的心上
我是個空虛的殼 少了愛就沒有了魂
徹底沒了魂

Oh baby, baby
Please tell me what to do
Thought that I could spend my whole life with you
A life with you

Oh baby, baby
Please tell me what to do
Hate myself for all the things I’ve done to you
All I’ve done to you

I don’t love myself so I just blamed you for loving me
Loving me
Yeah, for Loving me

I just don’t know how you could fall for a girl like me
For a girl like me
Full of emptiness
You might also like聽說要先愛自己 才能慢慢體會感情的真諦
但我卻漫無目的 只想快點找到人生的捷徑
上次犯過的錯 我又再次從頭來過
只好重新來過
沒有你的過

Oh baby, baby
Please tell me what to do
Thought that I could spend my whole life with you
A life with you

Oh baby, baby
Please tell me what to do
Hate myself for all the things I’ve done to you
All I’ve done to you

I don’t know how to love myself
I don’t know how to love you now
But I won’t give in to myself
I’ll just keep on searching now

I painted a picture, when I first got with you
But that beautiful picture
We both know it ain’t truth
Then what is true？Embed
