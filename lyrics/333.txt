Umm... Life - 비비
10 ContributorsUmm... Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh my God, honey, you look skinny
What happened to you?
Oh my God, BIBI, you look shitty
Who did this to you? Hm

[Chorus]
I'm like, "Umm..."
I'm like, "Umm..."
I'm like, "Umm..."
I'm like, like, like
Like "Life"

[Verse 2]
Oh my God, bish, you black and blue
Who did this to you?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Bish, you had a tough one?
Boy, you got a rough one?
Did it to me
So don't blame him, all the blues I have
These days, no, it's not on him, no, no
No, don't blame them
All the pains you had whole life
No, it's not on them, no, no
Then, what?
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm like, "Umm..."
I'm like, "Umm..."
I'm like, "Umm..."
I'm like, "Umm... Uh, uh"
Uh, "Life"3Embed
