Other Side of Town - OOHYO
5 ContributorsOther Side of Town Lyrics[Verse 1]
Trying to hold back
I thought I'd know you well by now
It's one of those days, you know
Trying to fight back
The tears from rolling down your back
It's one of those days, you know

[Verse 2]
It's one of those days (One of those days)
When they say (When they say)
You're just a fool (Just a fool)
You know it's true (You know it)
I never loved you (Never loved you)
I never need you (Never need you)
So go on and cry (So go on and cry)
Don't teach me how to live a life

[Chorus]
It's one of those days
Just one of those days
When you miss your mom and the little games you play
Don't try to run away
Don't try to run away
Come on over now to the other side of town
Come on over now to the real side of loveYou might also likeEmbed
