There for you (English) - Kim Na Young
1 ContributorThere for you (English) Lyrics[Verse 1]
On the street where the darkness fell
Your memory that I hid deeply
I took it out without realizing it
We were together at the same time
The stories that I've been trying to capture
Walk to me and wave your hand

[Chorus]
Actually, even if I pretend I'm fine
I'm afraid you'll find out how hard I feel
Trying hard to hide my shaky eyes
I'm looking at you

[Post-Chorus]
And I always can't say anything
Why do you look so bad?
That's how I spent it
I think of you in pain like that's how I feel

[Verse 2]
You're still the same as always
But your expression is very unfamiliar
A lot of stories that are in my heart

Even when we fought to the point where we raised our hands and feet
Even when I turned to you with my back on my back
Even when I ran away from you in panic
I was waiting for you. Turn around
You might also like[Chorus]
Actually, even if I pretend I'm fine
I'm afraid you'll find out how hard I feel
Trying hard to hide my shaky eyes
I'm looking at you

[Post-Chorus]
And I always can't say anything
Why do you look so bad?
That's how I spent it
You're in pain like that

[Chorus]
In fact, I pretended to be okay
The stories that are left in my heart...
Keep drawing
I still can't let you goEmbed
