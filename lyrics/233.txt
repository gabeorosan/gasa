Grace - OOHYO
3 ContributorsGrace Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see you walking down the street
I see you coming back inside
I know you’re wondering what all this means to you
I know you’re breaking down tonight
But do you know how much it hurts
To see you closing back that door?

[Chorus]
I love you, love you, love you
Just the way you are
Love you, love you, love you
The way you are
There's nothing in this world that I would ever want
Than to have you back in my arms

[Verse 2]
I want to see you really smile
Do you know it’s been a while
Have you noticed that you're far away from home?
Do you like it where you are?
Do they treat you like a star?
Do they sing for you the songs you always liked?

[Verse 3]
You’re scared of all the lies
All you want is a sign
Telling you where to go
There’s no other way to turn
The only lesson you learned
Is to never forget your way back home
You might also like[Chorus]
I love you, love you, love you
Just the way you are
Love you, love you, love you
The way you are
There's nothing in this world that I would ever want
Than to have you back in my arms

[Bridge]
Waiting for you
Deep in the night
To tuck you into bed
I’m waiting for you
Arms open wide
I want to see you smile tonight

[Chorus]
I love you, love you, love you
Just the way you are
Love you, love you, love you
The way you are
There's nothing in this world that I would ever want
Than to have you back in my arms2Embed
