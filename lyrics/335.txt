Birthday Cake - 비비
8 ContributorsBirthday Cake Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nobody told me
I can have the whole chocolate
So I fed it to my buddy
Nobody told me
I get grands for hour and half
So I sold it for one hunnit

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I allow myself to lose it, to lose it
Allow myself to lose it
Yeah, allow myself to lose it, to lose it
Allow myself to lose it

[Chorus]
'Cause I sold it for one hunnit
Sold it for one hunnit
I sold it for one hunnit
Yeah, I allow myself to lose it

[Verse 2]
Nobody told me
I can taste my own birthday cake
So I kept it in my closet
Nobody told me
I can throw myself, to doomsday lake
So I let myself go lose it

I couldn't allow myself to lose it, to lose it
Allow myself to lose it
No, I couldn't allow myself to lose it, to lose it
Allow myself to lose it

[Chorus]
'Cause I kept it in my closet
Kept it in my closet
I left it in my closet
Couldn't allow myself to lose it1Embed
