「ぼく」と「僕」 (Boku to ”Boku”) - Radwimps
1 Contributor「ぼく」と「僕」 (Boku to ”Boku”) Lyrics[RADWIMPS「「ぼく」と「僕」」歌詞]

I was standing naked next to him
He was looking at me
He was glancing at me
He said I should neither be usual or unusual
But there was nothing, nothing I could do
So I trust myself to call myself as "nothing"

Life gives you everything you need to live or to die no matter how
I was the only one who knew that's the most beautiful truth in this word

But I’m living here
Without any fear forgetting
That I'm just pretending to be
But I'm smiling
I’m not falling into the pond you go
When you feel like dying

He was flying over me
I tried to hide out so that no one is going to see me
Like I'm doing these for you and me and everyone
Who has never thought about being broken
I'm singing this song to fly away to the world
I'll never have to cry
