2 Contributors夏のせい (Blame Summer) -English Ver.- Lyrics​RADWIMPS「夏のせい (English Ver.)」の歌詞

Summers the one to blame
For making us feel we want to go
Love is the one to blame
For showing us how far we can go

The season that breathes
Life into all things
Exhilarates
Hearts dancing fast paced

Lets leave it all behind
Lets all get left behind
All summer long

Today the season will change
And a new one takes its place
I could tell from the sky
I just knew from the smell
Written on your face

Three seasons fall winter spring
You've been pushing through ahead
Hundred Twenty Percent
Kept on holding it in, just wait for the chance
With every breath that you take
I just feel that it makes
You so beautiful

Relax unwind
First of its kind
Never coming back
So vast and wide
I know it's here

Summers the one to blame
For making us feel we want to go
Love is the one to blame
For showing us how far we can go

This season won't last
Moves 5 times as fast
Over in what
Seems just like a blink

So why don't we just try
To stay here for all time
Or even more

Few thousand years from now
We'll all be gone from this place
Not even a trace
Summer won't ever change
It'll be singing again
But here and now this is our time
No one else can take away
Doing all that we can
Trying to make it last
Patiently waiting
Filling this summer jar
With so many memories
That the lid will pop off

Daytime and Night
Our gazing Eyes and
Perfect Vibes are
Prepared but insecure
Mixed up in the air tonight

You are the one to blame
For making me sing this song of love
Love is the one to blame
For making me promise you my all

Even if a few
Dreams break into two
And disappear into the starry night

If it's just me and you
There's no way we can lose
I know it's true
"Like the ice that's in the sun
The magic of summer can melt away quickly"
So nonchalantly
Suddenly you said to me
With a face exactly
Like a cool night breeze

Summers the one to blame
For making us feel we want to go
Love is the one to blame
For showing us how far we can go

This uncertainty and difficulty
Is what we are all holding onto
This season knows the way
For making us all shine

Summers the one to blame
For making us feel we want to go
Love is the one to blame
For showing us how far we can go

No scientist or
Any dreamer has solved
No renegade
Has even made the claim
The answer that we seek
Is right here in our hands

The season that breathes
Life into all things
Exhilarates
Hearts dancing fast paced
Till the very end of time
Let's leave it all behind
All summer longEmbed
