The sorrowful gust of wind that blew right between you and me
Where did it find the loneliness, it carried on the breeze?
Looking up at the sky after shedding a stream of tears
I could see for miles of blue, it's never been so clear

[Verse 1]
Speeches that my father gave me would always make me despair
Somehow, I feel a warmth and comfort today
Your ever kind heart, the way you smile and even how you find your dreams
I knew nothing, so honestly I've always copied you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, just a little more, only just a little more
Let's stay here a little longer now
Now, just a little more, only just a little more
Let's stick together just a little bit longer

[Chorus]
Oh yes, we are time fliers
Scaling the walls of time, climber
Tired of playing hide and seek with time and
Always coming just short
Crying even when you're happy
Smiling even when you're feeling lonely
It's because a part of you
Has made it here before the rest has

I used to wish upon the stars, the toys that I once adored
Forgotten now, are rolling 'round the corners of the floor
Finally, my dream has counted up to a hundred today
Someday, I'll trade them all for just the very one

[Verse 3]
Girl that I have seen in school, that never have told, "Hello"
After class today, I waved and said, "See you tomorrow"
It's not really that bad trying something new every once in a while
Especially if I can do it with you by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, just a little more, only just a little more
Let's stay here a little longer now
Now, just a little more, only just a little more
Let's stick together just a little bit longer

[Chorus]
Oh yes, we are time fliers, so and I
I knew who you were way before
Way before I even knew my own name
There's no clue, but I'm sure, I swear

[Verse 3]
Even if you're not around in this wide world
Of course it surely would have some kind of meaning
But if when you're not around in this crazy world
Would be like the month of August without summer break
And if you're not around in this great world
Would be like Santa Claus without any glee
If you're not around in this wide world
[Bridge]
Yes, we are time fliers
Scaling the walls of time, climber
Tired of playing hide and seek with time and
Always coming just short
No, never mind that
No, never mind what I said now
'Cause I'm on my way to you

[Chorus]
Oh, we are time fliers
Dashing up the steps of time now
No more playing hide and seek with you and time
And always coming just short
You're quite a showy crier
Want to stop your tears, see your eyes drier
But when I went to wipe your tears dry
You refused but I saw them pouring down your face, I knew why
Crying even when I'm happy
Smiling even when I'm feeling lonely
It's because the heart of mine
Has made it here before my body13Embed
