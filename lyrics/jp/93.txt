Zenzenzense (English Version) - Radwimps
16 ContributorsZenzenzense (English Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
At last, "Hello", you've opened your eyes
But why won't you even look me in the eyes, what's wrong with you?
You angrily tell me that I'm late
Well, I'm sorry, but I did my best and running at my fastest pace
My heart overtook my body as it flew to find you in this place

[Pre-Chorus]
Seeing your hair flowing and your bright eyes glowing aches my very core
Wish I could breathe in the same dimension, I don't want to let it go
Now that I am finally faced with the voice I've known for so long
I don't know what the words should be the very first I say to you

[Chorus]
Back in the zen-zen-zense till this day
Been looking everywhere for you (For you)
I followed the sound of your innocent laughter
And it guided me in the right way
Even if every piece of you disappeared
And if it scattered everywhere (Everywhere)
No, I won't waver, I'll start back at one
Look for you all over again
Or maybe instead I'll take the whole universe
Right back to zero again

[Verse 2]
Where should I start, how should I explain?
Wanna tell you everything that happened while you were in a long, long dream
I flew through dozens of skies
To tell you adventures I've been through hundreds of millions of light-years' worth
But now I'm here, finally seeing you reflected in my eyes

I just wanna know you, play around and show you who it is that you can be
I just wanna love you, every fragment of you, right down to the pain you feel
Now that we have finally met at many galaxies' end
I don't know how to hold your hand so that I don't break it

[Chorus]
Back in the zen-zen-zense till this day
Been looking everywhere for you (For you)
Oh, I love the sound of your unfettered voice
And the shedding of tears lead me this way
So tell me, who will ever gonna stop us
On this, the eve of our revolution? (Revolution)
No more hesitation, I will put up a flag
To stake my claim on your heart tonight (On your heart tonight)
'Cause you took away from me the way to give up
So clearly and awkwardly (And awkwardly)

[Interlude]
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Bridge]
I wonder if we can push our way through (Push our way through)
The countless barrier that's waiting in the future just beyond our view
Side by side, no way we can lose
We'll beat destiny at its own game and make it follow our own rules
And there isn't any weapon besides you that I need to use
[Chorus]
Zen-zen-zense till this day
Been looking everywhere for you (For you)
I follow the sound of your innocent laughter
And it guided me in the right way
Even if every piece of you disappeared
And if it scattered everywhere
No, I won't waver, I will start back at one
Look for you all over again (All over again)
For millions of light-years yet to come with a verse
On my lips that will never end10Embed
