Image Training - Nico Touches the Walls
1 ContributorImage Training LyricsAs yet AM5 Hitotsugi at TAXI well as reptiles of the earth
The remains of a red light crossing
As I was waiting for the wind leaves
I would not know the wind direction and
Also asked for the whereabouts of the weather forecast tomorrow
Such 当Taranu
I look there if the runway as the sun rose Hitotsugi
Get veneer wings
I turned and ran like a toy
I would not fly 羽Batakanakya
Even innocent figure reflects a skyscraper
Such Unreachable
Side of the building waiting for what kind of things?
Non-fragile? Have never seen something?
Before the wind and pushed back to you
Fly looking
I fly back and ran toward
Now to hesitate anymore
That neither side of the highway side of the building in the entangled
Floating image
How many times I turned and ran fly
振Ri返Ranu another town goodbye
Once the float must be at chest swell
Such brightYou might also likeEmbed
