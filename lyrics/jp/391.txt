Even if you go to dream world where
Hateful GANIMATA GIRL GANIMATA GIRL
Mab from sunset they Furimukeba
But that is dull, you still GANIMATA

Distorted mind every time you go out for a drive
Life for everyone even keep up with where exactly?
The trick is bitter GANIMATA
Rushed through streets bike

恋Sure to change it if I Tamerae
Hateful GANIMATA GIRL GANIMATA GIRL
Mab from sunset they Furimukeba

Give me a whim moderation
Fly fly fly
If you dream to meet
OK, OK I love
Even sunset disappear
Hateful GANIMATA GIRL GANIMATA GIRL
This feeling hotter tears
But because you are dull GANIMATA
