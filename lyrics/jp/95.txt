Is There Still Anything That Love Can Do? (English Version) - Radwimps
10 ContributorsIs There Still Anything That Love Can Do? (English Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Born with nothing in my hands
I stumbled upon this place
Falling through a crack in time
I was writhing in pain
When those who make it in this age
Are only those who learn how to take
And everyone is giving up
Where do we all take a breath?
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)

[Verse 2]
Governors and gods alike
Try to turn the other cheek
But even if you look away
The truth is always facing you
Courage and the strength of hope
The magical bond we share
We grow up only to forget
How we ever used them here
But same as you were on that day
I see you still standing there
Glowing in your innocence
You were always standing there
When the world turns its back on you
You find a way to stand and fight
Ready to face it all
I see you here, shining bright

I need to know
If there's still anything that love can do?
I need to know
If there's still anything that I can do?

[Chorus]
You are the one who found
My courage and I knew
I wanna pay it back and spend it all on you
You gave me love, we share
It's all because of you
You are the reason
Let me share this love with you

[Refrain]
I need to know
If there's still anything that love can do?
I need to know
If there's still anything that I can do?

[Verse 3]
What if our destiny
Was just a roll of the dice
Or if it's up to the Gods?
And if they feel like playing nice
A mission that we didn't choose
Like armor that we can't remove
Or maybe it's a distant wish?
Something that we can't refuse
Prayers that are never heard
Reunions that never occur
Arguments that never clear
Hate that doesn't disappear
I hear the voices that forgive
I see them standing hand in hand
But with its arms open wide
The earth embraces all again
[Refrain]
I need to know
If there's still anything that love can do?
I need to know
If there's still anything that I can do?

[Chorus]
You are the one who found
My courage and I knew
I wanna pay it back and spend it all on you
This love we raised together
Shaped by me and you
You are the reason
Let me live this love with you

[Refrain]
I need to know
If there's still anything that love can do?
I need to know
If there's still anything that I can do?

[Bridge]
So insignificant just you and me
So why were we given this dream?
And if this life is just going to end
Tell me, why were we allowed to feel hope?
And if it's just gonna slip out of my hands
Then why even give it to me?
'Cause ain't it sad how we try to hold on
Knowing one day, it'll be gone
Or maybe it's beautiful?
Answer me!
[Outro]
All these love songs we hear
Already, they've been sung to death
All the movies that we've seen
They said everything they can
But somehow you and me
Fell into this wilderness
But still, I need to know
I need to know
If there's still anything that love can do?
I need to know
If there's still anything that I can do?6Embed
