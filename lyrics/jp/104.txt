1 ContributorB.C.G LyricsHadorifu Re
Gnarled remains
Re stale image
Eaters put pinch passions GOES ON
Once the roar shaking
Who will hear even sarcasm
Distorted face up stage
Yuppie curtain up you'll
Hello Abracadabra
Pressel eyes sad tone
Are you hurt
Harmonics in an impromptu
Us against the dark past
The soul Hadorifu
Me to expose the world of darkness
Come Abracadabra
If there is to
Come follow me
A minor red passion and loneliness
Exposed to rain, blue B minor
C minor, even elegant flock of swans
I'm not an enemy in D minor
E Minor Grey worst best
Brown Ponytail F a minor
After ending Rya G minor
Only the sound of noise because of the enormous
A minor red passion and loneliness
Exposed to rain, blue B minor
C minor, even elegant flock of swans
I'm not an enemy in D minor
E Minor Grey worst best
Brown Ponytail was F minor
'll Leave it to you later G minor
Farewell
Today Hadorifu Re
Gnarled remains
Harmonics in an impromptu
Emergency Re passionsYou might also likeEmbed
