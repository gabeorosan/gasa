Remember - 유라
4 ContributorsRemember Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember what
You said at that moment
You tried to runaway from yourself
Everything's gonna change, you feel it
So there is nothing left for me to do

[Chorus]
I think you messed up
Look at me I’m stuck in trouble
Somebody just tell us
I think I’m done we can’t take no more
Every night crying with this feeling
My time was still alive
I think you messed up
Someone stop this tragedy
Where is my hometown?

[Verse 2]
I remember
What you said at that moment
You had me hooked again from myself
Everything's gonna change
You feel it (causе I lost my light)
So there is nothing left for mе to do
You might also likeYeah yeah No matter what they tell me
Yeah yeah I’ll try to fix all of it
Yeah yeah No matter
What they judge me
Yeah yeah I can’t stop

[Chorus]
I think you messed up
Look at me I’m stuck in trouble
Somebody just tell us
I think I’m done we can’t take no more
Every night crying with this feeling
My time was still alive
I think you messed up
Someone stop this tragedy
Where is my hometown? town town
Where is my hometown? town town

[Bridge]
I remember
What you did with the silence
So there is nothing left for me to do

[Chorus]
I think you messed up
Look at me I’m stuck in trouble
Somebody just tell us
I think I’m done we can’t take no more
Every night crying with this feeling
My time was still alive
I think you messed up
Someone stop this tragedy
Where is my hometown?Embed
