Motorcycle - OOHYO
2 ContributorsMotorcycle LyricsIt’s not what I say
It’s only what you say
Through me
Through me
Oh through me
It's not what I do
It’s only what you do
Through me
Through me
Oh through me yeah
You are the light that guides me further
There is no other place I would rather be but here
The night is cold
The wind has speed
It doesn’t matter
'Cause I have you
And you have me
On this motorcycle
Lalalalala

Lalalalala
Lalalalalala la
Lalalalala
Lalalalalala la
It’s not what I say
It’s only what you say
Through me
Through me
Oh through me
It's not what I do
It’s only what you do
Through me
Through me
Oh through me yeahYou might also likeEmbed
