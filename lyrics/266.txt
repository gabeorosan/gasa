2 ContributorsQuiet Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see your grace
In every face
Words can’t explain
The sound you make
It comes through my heart
Spreads the seas apart
Every knee will drop to the ground
In awe of you

[Verse 2]
Lord, here I am
Take me away
Carry me away
I’m here to stay
They reason with your love
Your love, your love
Your love
But there is no reasonin your loveYou might also likeEmbed
