    "lyrics": "I don't want to grow up, but somehow,\nI'm getting more and more jaded.\nI don't have youth to spare,\nbut I want to hold onto it because it's too precious.\n\"I love you to death,\"\nbut those who say that can't die.\nI want to see you, I love you, I can't bear it; phrases like that, even though they could apply to anyone, unintentionally slipping out... I don't understand it.\nOnce more, I want to throw away this kind of life.\nI want to wait for you at the summer bus stop,\nI'm a loser, so I only have memories.\nThey say running away is shameful but useful, but honestly, I can't stand.\nI don't want to grow up, but since when\nhave I become good at smiling?\nI don't have life to spare,\nand I don't need friends like that.\nI'll pack the bare minimum,\nand I thought I'd go see you.\nI can't bear it, can I?\nOne more time, even if I drop one more, I can't die.\nEven if I keep losing, your laughing looks like a fool, doesn't it?\nFor the rest of my life, we who don't want to regret want to howl.\nI want to live like a losing dog barking,\nI don't even want to see your face like that.\nIf you're going to name life,\nthe word 'hope' is wrong, isn't it?\nHow many years have I been waiting, don't you know?\nI don't care about anything other than you,\nthat's the only thing I knew, isn't it?\nOne more time, even if I walk one more step, I can't say,\nIs music resonating after all, is everything satisfactory?\nOne more time, we don't need an encore,\nPut on a barking face, you hypocrite.\nOne more time, if I walk one more step, I lose,\nWill I sing even for world peace? Save everything quickly with love or whatever,\nEnough, I want to bet everything on this kind of life,\nAs a loser, I keep singing regret,\nI lose to dreams again, cherishing yesterday."
